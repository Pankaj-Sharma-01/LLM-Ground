From\\nthe beginning, there were several indications that it would be an exciting, albeit\\ndifficult, project: a relatively short timeline and a somewhat unfamiliar space,\\nbut a well-known brand and the chance to help design something that’d be seen\\nby many across the world. These kinds of projects have always been my favorite\\nbecause they are the ones that offer the most opportunity to learn and grow,\\nwhich I’ve always striven to do. But this project was somewhat unique in one\\nspecific way: I was being asked to justify a number of design decisions to project\\nstakeholders, without any data to support them. Normally, when you have quanti-\\ntative or qualitative data available to draw upon, this is a pretty straightforward\\ntask—but in this case the data wasn’t available, so the process of justifying the\\ndecisions would have to be a little different. How do you validate initial designs\\nwithout any proof that there is a need to change the existing designs to begin\\nwith? As you can imagine, design reviews quickly became a matter of subjectivity\\nand personal bias, resulting in designs that were more difficult to validate.\\nThen it occurred to me: psychology, which provides a deeper understanding\\nof the human mind, could be helpful in these circumstances. I quickly became\\nimmersed in the rich and expansive field of behavioral and cognitive psychology,\\nand found myself reading through countless research papers and articles in order\\nto find empirical evidence that supported the design decisions I was making.\\nThis research became quite useful in convincing project stakeholders to move\\nin the proposed design direction, and I felt as if I had found a treasure trove\\nof knowledge that would ultimately make me a better designer. There was only\\none problem: finding good reference material online quickly turned into an\\nexhausting task. Searches led me to a vast array of academic papers, scientific\\nresearch, and the occasional article in the popular press—none of which felt\\nvii\\ndirectly relatable to my work as a designer. I was looking for a designer-friendly\\nresource that just wasn’t available online, or at least not in the form I wanted it.\\nEventually I decided to dive in and produce the resource I was looking for myself,\\nresulting in the creation of a website called Laws of UX ( Figure P-1). This passion\\nproject became a way for me to both learn and document what I was discovering\\nat this time.\\nFigure P-1. Screenshot of the Laws of UX website, circa 2020\\nThe absence of quantitative or qualitative data related to the project I was\\nworking on led me to look elsewhere, and what I discovered regarding the inter-\\nsection of psychology and user experience (UX) design has been nothing short\\nof transformative for my practice. While such data, where available, remains\\nvaluable, my foray into psychology helped form a solid foundation for my work\\ngrounded in an understanding of how people behave, and why. This book is an\\nexpansion of the Laws of UX website that focuses on various psychological prin-\\nciples and concepts that I’ve found particularly useful as a designer. It’s impor-\\ntant to note they are not actual laws intended to be strictly followed—rather,\\nit’s helpful to think of them as guidelines that help inform design decisions\\nbased on patterns of human behavior that’ve been observed time and time again.\\nThey’re not a replacement for user research, but they can be incredibly valuable\\nfor interpreting why people behave a certain way in general.\\nVIII | PREFACE\\nSecond Edition\\nThe craft of design has a dynamic nature that keeps evolving along with\\ntechnology. With every new technological advancement, new constraints and\\npossibilities are introduced. Since the first edition of this book, LLMs (Large\\nLanguage Models) have undergone significant advancements, AI-powered image\\ngeneration tools have emerged, spatial computing has entered the mainstream,\\nand smartphones have become even more powerful. However, the principles\\nand concepts covered in this book remain timeless, and they provide a solid\\nfoundation for every designer, regardless of their level of expertise. To enhance\\nthe reader’s experience, the second edition includes additional information link-\\ning these principles and concepts to psychology concepts, techniques, and key\\nconsiderations. This edition also features updated examples throughout, making\\nit a practical guide for designers who want to stay up to date with the latest trends\\nand best practices in the field of design.\\nWhy I Wrote This Book\\nI wrote this book in order to make complex laws of psychology accessible to\\nmore designers—specifically designers who don’t have background knowledge\\nin psychology or behavioral science. The intersection of psychology and UX\\ndesign has become an increasingly relevant topic in an era when design roles\\nare having an ever-stronger impact within organizations. Along with a growing\\nfocus on design, there has been an increase in debate around which additional\\nskills designers should learn, if any, to increase their value and contribution.\\nShould designers code, write, or understand business? Any of these skills could\\nbe valuable depending on the project, team, and industry. However, I would\\nargue that every designer should learn the fundamentals of psychology.\\nAs humans, we have an underlying “blueprint” for how we perceive and\\nprocess the world around us, and the study of psychology helps us decipher\\nthis blueprint. Designers can use this knowledge to build more intuitive, human-\\ncentered products and experiences. Instead of forcing users to adapt to the\\ndesign of a product or experience, we can use some key principles from psychol-\\nogy as a guide for designing in a way that is adapted to people. This is the\\nfundamental basis of human-centered design, and it’s the foundation of this\\nbook.\\nPREFACE | IX\\nBut knowing where to start can be a challenge. Which principles from psy-\\nchology are useful? What are some examples of these principles at work? There’s\\nan endless list of laws and theories that occupy this space, but there are a few\\nthat I’ve found particularly helpful and widely applicable. In this book, I explore\\nthese concepts and present some examples of how they are effectively leveraged\\nby products and experiences we interact with every day.\\nWho This Book Is For\\nThis book is for anyone who wishes to improve their design craft, learn more\\nabout the intersection of psychology and design, or simply explore why people\\nreact to good design the way they do. It’s aimed at designers who want to have\\na better understanding of psychology and how it impacts and overlaps with\\nthe work we do. It’s for professional and aspiring designers alike: anyone who\\nseeks to understand how the overall user experience is affected by an understand-\\ning of human perception and mental processes. While the book is specifically\\nfocused on digital design as opposed to the more traditional media of graphic\\nor industrial design, the information it contains is broadly applicable to anyone\\nresponsible for shaping user experience. I should also mention that it isn’t\\nintended to be a comprehensive resource, but rather an accessible introduction\\nto the psychology fundamentals that have a direct influence on design and how\\npeople process and interact with the interfaces we create. It’s full of examples and\\nintended to be easily read and referenced by designers who wish to incorporate\\nthis information into their daily work.\\nThis book will also be relevant to anyone who seeks to understand the busi-\\nness value of good design and why good design is transformative for businesses\\nand organizations. The field of UX design has grown and expanded into new\\nareas thanks to the increase in investment by companies looking to gain a com-\\npetitive advantage. With this new interest has come the expectation that products\\nand services should be well designed, and simply having a website or mobile\\napplication is no longer enough. Companies must ensure their websites and\\napplications, and any other digital experiences they offer, are helpful, effective,\\nand well designed. In order to achieve this goal, designers can, I believe, use\\npsychology as a guide, enabling them to design for how people actually perceive,\\nprocess, and interact, not only with digital interfaces but also with the world.\\nX | PREFACE\\nWhat’s in This Book\\nChapter 1, “Jakob’s Law”\\nUsers spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to\\nwork the same way as all the other sites they already know.\\nChapter 2, “Fitts’s Law”\\nThe time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the\\ntarget.\\nChapter 3, “Miller’s Law”\\nThe average person can keep only 7 (± 2) items in their working memory.\\nChapter 4, “Hick’s Law”\\nThe time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and com-\\nplexity of choices available.\\nChapter 5, “Postel’s Law”\\nBe conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.\\nChapter 6, “Peak–End Rule”\\nPeople judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and\\nat its end, rather than on the total sum or average of every moment of the\\nexperience.\\nChapter 7, “Aesthetic–Usability Effect”\\nUsers often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more\\nusable.\\nChapter 8, “Von Restorff Effect”\\nWhen multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the\\nrest is most likely to be remembered.\\nChapter 9, “Tesler’s Law”\\nTesler’s law, also known as the law of conservation and complexity, states\\nthat for any system there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be\\nreduced.\\nChapter 10, “Doherty Threshold”\\nProductivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace\\n(<400 ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.\\nPREFACE | XI\\nChapter 11, “Applying Psychological Principles in Design”\\nThis chapter considers ways designers can internalize and apply the psy-\\nchological principles we’ve looked at in this book and then articulate them\\nthrough principles that relate back to the goals and priorities of their team.\\nChapter 12, “With Power Comes Responsibility”\\nHere, we take a closer look at the implications of using psychology to create\\nmore intuitive products and experiences.\\nA Brief History of Psychology and Design\\nA little context can make a big difference, so I would like to begin this book\\nby providing some history on the overlap between psychology and design. My\\nintention is not to provide a comprehensive account but rather to offer a brief\\nintroduction that will enhance the upcoming chapters and place them in a histor-\\nical context.\\nGESTALT PSYCHOLOGY\\nWe’ll begin with Gestalt psychology, which is a psychological perspective that\\nemerged in the early 20th century. It emphasized the idea that human percep-\\ntion and understanding of the world are not simply the sum of individual sensory\\nexperiences but rather a meaningful whole. Gestalt psychology pioneers such as\\nMax Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler believed that individuals\\nperceive and interpret stimuli by organizing them into patterns and structures,\\nrather than perceiving them as isolated elements. They studied how individu-\\nals perceive visual illusions, problem solving, and the organization of sensory\\ninformation. The principles of Gestalt psychology, such as the figure–ground\\nrelationship, similarity, proximity, and closure, continue to be influential in the\\nfield of design.\\nHUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING\\nPsychology has played a crucial role in our understanding of the interaction\\nbetween humans and machines. It was psychologists who established human\\nfactors engineering, a discipline that focused on designing tools, machines, and\\nsystems that take into account human capabilities, limitations, and characteris-\\ntics. During World War II, the discipline gained significant momentum as the\\nUS military recognized the importance of optimizing equipment and cockpit\\ninterfaces for aircraft. Psychologists Paul Fitts and Alphonse Chapanis observed\\nthat humans are prone to errors, particularly when under stress, regardless of\\nXII | PREFACE\\n1 Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant, User Friendly: How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way\\nWe Live, Work, and Play (New Y ork: MCD/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2019), 86.\\ntheir training. 1 They also recognized that machines could be designed to align\\nwith human capabilities and limitations, thereby reducing these errors. This\\ninsight led to the development of principles that became fundamental to the dis-\\ncipline. After World War II, human factors engineering principles were applied\\nand developed in the aviation industry to enhance safety and efficiency through\\nstudies on pilot performance, cockpit design, and human–machine interactions.\\nHUMAN–COMPUTER INTERACTION\\nPsychology has also played a fundamental role in shaping the development of\\ncomputers and how we interact with them. The combination of psychology,\\nsystems analysis, and computer science became a defining characteristic of\\nresearch institutes during the Cold War era, much of which was linked to the\\ndefense establishment and large mainframe computers. In these early years of\\ncomputer science, computers were primarily engineered rather than designed,\\nwhich meant that users had to adapt to how these computers operated. The\\nconcept of personal computing was still a distant dream that only a few dared to\\nimagine, most notably Douglas Engelbart in his work at the Stanford Research\\nInstitute (resulting in the computer mouse, the development of hypertext, net-\\nworked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces, to name a few\\noutcomes).\\nAdvancements in technology led to a recognition of the importance of\\ndesigning systems that catered to human cognitive and physical abilities. Engi-\\nneers started focusing on computer users and began developing new input\\nmethods and exploring different applications for the machines. It was during\\nthis period that the notion of ubiquitous computing would start taking shape\\nat the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), which explored how small and\\ninexpensive internet-connected computers could help with everyday functions in\\nan automated fashion. Founded in 1970 with the goal of inventing “the office\\nof the future,” Xerox PARC gave birth to numerous innovations, including laser\\nprinting, desktop computing, Ethernet, and natural language processing. A pivo-\\ntal moment in the integration of psychology and computer science came from\\nXerox PARC with the publication of The Psychology of Human–Computer Interac-\\ntion (CRC Press) in 1983 by Stuart K. Card, Thomas P. Moran, and Allen Newell,\\nwhich had a profound impact on the development of personal computing, as they\\napplied cognitive psychology to enhance human interaction with computers.\\nPREFACE | XIII\\nAnother significant contribution from Xerox PARC was Smalltalk, an object-\\noriented programming language that enabled easy manipulation of multiple\\nwindows, mimicking the way people organize physical documents on a desk.\\nSmalltalk established the metaphorical desktop that would become a mental\\nmodel for future operating systems and was used in the development of the first\\ngraphical user interface (GUI). Alan Kay played a crucial role in the development\\nof Smalltalk and in shifting the paradigm from a text-based office information\\nsystem to a personal multimedia communication device.\\nKay’s inspiration for how we could interact with computers came from his\\nvisit to Seymour Papert’s Logo project at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\\nPapert had spent five years working with Jean Piaget, a psychologist who studied\\nthe ways in which children learn, and was inspired to create the educational pro-\\ngramming language with the goal of teaching children concepts in mathematics\\nand computer programming. It was Papert’s Logo project that convinced Kay that\\ncomputer programming languages should be developed on a level that children\\ncould understand and use. Another significant influence on Kay was the work\\nof psychologist Jerome Bruner, who studied different learning mentalities in\\nchildren.\\nUSER EXPERIENCE DESIGN\\nUser experience (UX) design emerged from the field of human–computer inter-\\naction (HCI) alongside the rise of the World Wide Web and the need for better\\ninteraction design. One of the key figures in the early development of UX design\\nis cognitive scientist and psychologist Donald Norman, who began his career as\\npart of a committee tasked with investigating the Three Mile Island nuclear dis-\\naster in 1979. Norman would later coin the term “user experience” to encompass\\nall aspects of the end user’s interaction with a system, including the interface,\\ngraphics, industrial design, physical interaction, and more, while at Apple. He\\nemphasized the importance of designing products that not only are functional\\nbut also provide a positive and satisfying experience for the user.\\nAnother influential figure who played a key role in shaping our understand-\\ning of design and its impact on user experience is Jane Fulton Suri, best known\\nfor pioneering the practice of human-centered design (HCD) at the renowned\\ncompany IDEO. With a unique educational background in psychology and\\narchitecture, Suri’s approach integrated ethnographic research, observation tech-\\nniques, and cross-disciplinary collaboration into a blended approach to gain deep\\ninsights into user behaviors and needs. Her work has helped shape UX design\\ninto a discipline that deeply considers the human experience at its core.\\nXIV | PREFACE\\nPsychology continues to inform how we can design systems that align with\\nhow people actually are, rather than how we want them to be. While technol-\\nogy and our interactions with it will keep evolving, psychology offers a lens\\nto decipher the fundamental “blueprint” of how we perceive and process the\\nworld. Armed with this understanding, designers can create more intuitive and\\nuser-centered products and experiences by shaping the technology to fit the user,\\nrather than the other way around.\\nO’Reilly Online Learning\\nFor more than 40 years, O’Reilly Media has provided tech-\\nnology and business training, knowledge, and insight to\\nhelp companies succeed.\\nOur unique network of experts and innovators share their knowledge and\\nexpertise through books, articles, and our online learning platform.

Familiarity\\nhelps the people interacting with a digital product or service know immediately\\nhow to use it, from interacting with the navigation to finding the content they\\nneed to processing the layout and visual cues on the page in order to under-\\nstand the choices available to them. The cumulative effect of mental effort saved\\nensures a lower cognitive load. In other words, the less mental energy users have\\nto spend learning an interface, the more they can dedicate to achieving their\\n1\\n| 1\\n1 Jakob Nielsen, “End of Web Design, ” Nielsen Norman Group, July 22, 2000, https:/ /oreil.ly/-kfBV.\\n2 Jakob Nielsen, “Mental Models, ” Nielsen Norman Group, October 17 , 2010, https:/ /oreil.ly/2zrw7.\\nobjectives. The easier we make it for people to achieve their goals, the more likely\\nthey are to do so successfully.\\nAs designers, it is our objective to ensure people successfully achieve their\\ngoals when using the interfaces we’ve built by eliminating as much friction as\\npossible. Not all friction is bad—in fact, sometimes it is even necessary. But\\nwhen there is an opportunity to remove or avoid extraneous friction, or friction\\nthat doesn’t provide value or serve a purpose, then we should do so. One of the\\nprimary ways designers can remove friction is by leveraging common design\\npatterns and conventions in strategic areas such as page structure, workflows,\\nnavigation, and placement of expected elements such as search. When we do\\nthis, we ensure people can immediately be productive instead of first having to\\nlearn how a website or app works. In this chapter, we’ll take a look at some\\nexamples of how this design principle can be achieved—but first, let’s look at its\\norigins.\\nOrigins\\nJakob’s law (also known as “Jakob’s law of the internet user experience”) was put\\nforth in 2000 by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for\\nusers to develop an expectation of design conventions based on their cumulative\\nexperience from other websites. 1 This observation, which Nielsen describes as\\na law of human nature, encourages designers to follow common design conven-\\ntions, enabling users to focus more on the site’s content, message, or product.\\nIn contrast, uncommon conventions can lead to people becoming frustrated,\\nconfused, and more likely to abandon their tasks and leave because the interface\\ndoes not match up with their understanding of how things should work.\\nThe cumulative experience that Nielsen refers to is helpful for people when\\nvisiting a new website or using a new product because it informs their under-\\nstanding of how things work and what’s possible. This underlying factor is\\nperhaps one of the most important in user experience, and it is directly related to\\na psychological concept known as mental models.2\\n2 | LAWS OF UX\\n3 Donald A.

Whether it’s a digital system such as a website or\\na physical system such as a checkout line in a retail store, we form a\\nmodel of how a system works, and then we apply that model to new\\nsituations in which the system is similar. In other words, we use the\\nknowledge we already have from past experiences when interacting with\\nsomething new.\\nMental models are valuable for designers because we can match\\nour designs to our users’ mental models to improve their experience\\nby enabling them to easily transfer their knowledge from one product\\nor experience to another, without the need to first take the time to\\nunderstand how the new system works. Good user experiences are made\\npossible when the design of a product or service is in alignment with\\nthe user’s mental model. The task of shrinking the gap between our own\\nmental models and those of the users is one of the biggest challenges\\nwe face, and to achieve this goal we use a variety of methods: user inter-\\nviews, personas, journey maps, empathy maps, and more. The point of\\nthese various methods is to gain a deeper insight into not only the goals\\nand objectives of our users but also users’ preexisting mental models\\nand how all of these factors apply to the product or experience we are\\ndesigning.\\nExamples\\nHave you ever wondered why form controls look the way they do ( Figure 1-1)? It’s\\nbecause the humans designing them had a mental model of what these elements\\nshould look like, which they based on control panels they were familiar with in\\nthe physical world. The design of interactive elements like form toggles, radio\\ninputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile counterparts\\nand, therefore, builds upon the conceptual model of what these elements should\\ndo and how they should work. The affordance3 of these elements, which is the\\nJAKOB’S LAW | 3\\nrelationship between them and the user in regard to what actions are possible,\\nis clear due to the mapping between them and similar controls in the physical\\nworld.\\nFigure 1-1. Comparison between control panel elements and typical form elements\\n(source: Jonathan H. Ward [left], Google’s Material Design, 2023 [right])\\nWhen our designs do not align with the user’s existing mental model, such\\nas when a familiar product is suddenly changed, it’s likely the user will become\\nconfused. A mismatch of mental models can affect not only how users perceive\\nthe products and services we’ve helped build but also the speed at which they\\nunderstand them.\\nOne notorious example of mental model mismatch is the 2018 redesign of\\nSnapchat. Instead of gradually introducing changes through slow iteration and\\nextensive beta testing, the company launched a major overhaul that dramatically\\nchanged the familiar format of the app by combining watching stories and com-\\nmunicating with friends in the same place. Unhappy users immediately took\\nto Twitter and expressed their disapproval en masse. Even worse was the subse-\\nquent migration of users to Snapchat’s competitor, Instagram. Snap CEO Evan\\nSpiegel had hoped that the redesign would reinvigorate advertisers and allow for\\nads to be customized to users, but instead it caused ad views and revenue to drop\\nand led to the app’s user count dramatically shrinking. Snapchat failed to ensure\\nthe mental model of its users would be aligned with the redesigned version of the\\napp, and the resulting mismatch caused a major backlash.\\n4 | LAWS OF UX\\nBut major redesigns don’t always drive users away—just ask Google. Google\\nhas a history of allowing users to opt in to redesigned versions of its products,\\nlike Google Calendar, YouTube, and Gmail. When the company launched a\\nnew version of YouTube in 2017 ( Figure 1-2) after years of essentially the same\\ndesign, it allowed desktop users to ease into the new Material Design UI without\\nhaving to commit. Users could preview the new design, gain some familiarity,\\nsubmit feedback, and even revert to the old version if they preferred it. The\\ninevitable mental model mismatch was mitigated by simply empowering users to\\nswitch when they were ready.\\nFigure 1-2. Before (left) and after (right) comparison of YouTube redesign in 2017\\n(source: YouTube)\\nJAKOB’S LAW | 5\\nMost ecommerce websites also leverage preexisting mental models.  By mak-\\ning use of familiar patterns and conventions, shopping sites such as Etsy ( Fig-\\nure 1-3) can effectively keep customers focused on the important stuff—finding\\nand purchasing products. By conforming to users’ expectations about the process\\nof selecting products, adding them to the virtual cart, and checking out, designers\\ncan ensure users are able to apply their accumulated knowledge from previous\\necommerce experiences; the whole process feels comfortable and familiar.\\nFigure 1-3. Etsy leverages preexisting mental models to keep customers focused on purchasing\\nproducts rather than on learning new interaction patterns (source: Etsy, 2023)\\n6 | LAWS OF UX\\nThe use of mental models to inform design isn’t isolated to the digital\\nspace. Some of my favorite examples can be found in the automotive industry,\\nspecifically in regard to controls. Take, for instance, the 2023 Mercedes-Benz\\nEQS SUV ( Figure 1-4). The seat controls found on the door panel next to each\\nseat are mapped to the shape of the seat. The resulting design makes it easy for\\nusers to understand which part of their seat they can adjust by identifying the\\ncorresponding button. It’s an effective design because it builds on our preexisting\\nmental model of a car seat and then matches the controls to that mental model.\\nFigure 1-4. Seat controls in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV,\\ninformed by our mental model of a car seat (source: Mercedes-Benz, 2023)\\nJAKOB’S LAW | 7\\nBuilding upon existing mental models through the use of common compo-\\nnents and interaction patterns to ensure familiarity is an effective way to intro-\\nduce people to new technology as well. Take, for example, Apple’s Vision Pro,\\nwhich makes use of components like sidebars, tabs, and search fields that people\\nrecognize and already understand how to use ( Figure 1-5 ). Content is placed\\ninside “windows” that live in your space and feel like part of the surroundings.\\nThe glass material that makes up windows provides contrast with the world,\\ngives people more awareness of their surroundings, and adapts to different light-\\ning conditions. The system provides controls to move, close, and resize windows,\\nenabling users to place content comfortably in their physical environment.\\nFigure 1-5. Apple’s Vision Pro makes use of common components and interaction patterns\\n(source: Apple, 2023)\\n8 | LAWS OF UX\\nTECHNIQUE\\nUser Personas\\nHave you ever heard another designer within your company or organi-\\nzation refer to “the user, ” but it wasn’t quite clear who exactly this elu-\\nsive person was? The process of design becomes more difficult when\\na design team lacks a clear definition of its target audience, leaving\\neach designer to interpret it in their own way. User personas are a tool\\nthat helps solve this problem by framing design decisions based on real\\nneeds, not the generic needs of the undefined “user. ” These fictional\\nrepresentations of a specific subset of the target audience are based on\\naggregated data from real users of a product or service (Figure 1-6).\\nPersonas are intended to foster empathy and serve as memory aids,\\nas well as to create a shared mental model of the traits, needs, motiva-\\ntions, and behaviors of a specific kind of user. The frame of reference\\nthat personas help to define is incredibly valuable for teams: it helps\\nteam members move away from self-referential thinking and focus on\\nthe needs and goals of the user, which is useful for prioritizing new\\nfeatures.\\nFigure 1-6. User persona example\\nJAKOB’S LAW | 9\\nAny details about the user that are relevant to the feature or product\\nyou’re building will be useful as long as they’re based on research that’s\\nbeen conducted with real users—completely fictional personas can be\\nuseful in guiding the team in the same direction, but it might not be the\\nright direction if it’s not grounded in research from your actual users. The\\nitems common to most personas include the following:\\nInfo\\nItems such as a photo, memorable tagline, name, age, and occupa-\\ntion are all relevant for the information section of a persona. The\\nidea here is to create a realistic representation of the members of\\na specific group within your target audience, so this data should be\\nreflective of the similarities they share.\\nDetails\\nThe information within the details section of a user persona helps\\nto build empathy and align focus on the characteristics that impact\\nwhat is being designed. Common information here includes a bio to\\ncreate a deeper narrative around the persona, behavioral qualities\\nthat are relevant, and frustrations this particular group might have.\\nAdditional details could include things such as goals and motiva-\\ntions, or tasks the user might perform while using the product or\\nfeature.\\nInsights\\nThe insights section of a user persona helps to frame the attitude\\nof the user. The intention here is to add an additional layer of con-\\ntext that provides further definition of the specific persona and\\ntheir mindset. This section often includes direct quotes from user\\nresearch.\\n10 | LAWS OF UX\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nSameness\\nThe examples we explored demonstrate how we can leverage users’\\nexisting mental models to enable them to become immediately produc-\\ntive. In contrast, failure to consider the mental model a user has formed\\ncan result in confusion and frustration. The conclusion here also invites\\nan important question: does Jakob’s law argue that all websites or apps\\nshould behave identically? Additionally, does it suggest that we should\\nuse only preexisting UX patterns, even when there’s a more appropriate\\nsolution that’s new?\\nI know what you’re thinking: if all websites or apps followed the\\nsame design conventions, that would make everything quite boring. This\\nis a completely valid concern, especially given the ubiquity of specific\\nconventions that can be observed today. This pervasive sameness can\\nbe attributed to a few factors: the popularity of frameworks to speed up\\ndevelopment, the maturity of digital platforms and resulting standards,\\nclients’ desire to emulate their competition, and just plain lack of creativ-\\nity. While much of this sameness is purely based on design trends, there\\nis a good reason we see patterns with some conventions, such as the\\nplacement of search, navigation in the footer, and multistep checkout\\nflows.\\nLet’s take a moment to consider the alternative: imagine that each\\nand every website or app that you used was completely different in every\\nregard, from the layout and navigation down to the styling and common\\nconventions like the location of the search feature. Considering what\\nwe’ve learned about mental models, this would mean that users could\\nno longer rely on their previous experiences to guide them. Their ability\\nto be instantly productive in achieving the goal they wanted to accom-\\nplish would immediately be thwarted because they would first have to\\nlearn how to use the website or app. Every task that they’d want to\\naccomplish would require some degree of exploration to find what they\\nwere looking for and then experimentation to understand how it works.\\nT ake, for example, something as simple as navigation—finding it would\\nrequire precious mental energy when it’s not where they’d expect, and\\neven worse would be the trial and error that would result when it doesn’t\\nfunction the way they’d expect. It takes no stretch of the imagination\\nJAKOB’S LAW | 11\\nto see that this would not be an ideal situation, and conventions would\\neventually emerge out of pure necessity.\\nThat’s not to say that creating something entirely new is never\\nappropriate—there’s certainly a time and a place for innovation. Some\\nrules are made to be broken, and breaking them could even become a\\nway to differentiate from competitors. Designers must determine the\\nbest approach by taking into consideration user needs and context,\\nin addition to any technical constraints, before reaching for something\\nunique, and they must take care not to sacrifice usability by rigorously\\ntesting their work.\\nConclusion\\nJakob’s law isn’t advocating for sameness in the sense that every product and\\nexperience should be identical. Instead, it is a guiding principle that reminds\\ndesigners that people leverage previous experience to help them in understand-\\ning new experiences. It is a not-so-subtle suggestion that (when appropriate)\\ndesigners should consider common conventions that are built around existing\\nmental models to ensure users can immediately be productive instead of first\\nneeding to learn how a website or app works. Designing in a way that conforms\\nto expectations allows users to apply their knowledge from previous experiences,\\nand the resulting familiarity ensures they can stay focused on the important\\nstuff: finding the information they need, purchasing a product, etc.\\nThe best piece of advice I can give in regard to Jakob’s law is to always\\nbegin with common patterns and conventions, leveraging tools like a design\\nsystem when available, and depart from them only when it makes sense to. If\\nyou can make a compelling argument for making something different to improve\\nthe core user experience, that’s a good sign that it’s worth exploring. If you go\\nthe unconventional route, be sure to test your design with users to ensure they\\nunderstand how it works.\\n12 | LAWS OF UX\\n\\n\\nFitts’s Law\\nThe time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the\\ntarget.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• T ouch targets should be large enough for users to accurately\\nselect them.\\n• T ouch targets should have ample spacing between them.\\n• T ouch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow\\nthem to be easily acquired.\\nOverview\\nUsability is a key aspect of good design. It implies ease of use, which means the\\ninterface should be easy for users to understand and navigate. Interaction should\\nbe painless and straightforward, requiring minimal effort. The time it takes for\\nusers to move to and engage with an interactive object is a critical metric. It’s\\nimportant that designers size and position interactive objects appropriately to\\nensure they are easily selectable and meet user expectations with regard to the\\nselectable region—a challenge compounded by the differing precision of the\\nrange of input methods available today (mouse, finger, etc.) and the variable\\ndexterity of users.\\nTo aid in this endeavor, we can apply Fitts’s law, which states that the time\\nit takes for a user to engage with an object is relative to its size and the distance\\n15\\n| 2\\n1 Paul M. Fitts, “The Information Capacity of the Human Motor System in Controlling the Amplitude of\\nMovement, ” Journal of Experimental Psychology 47 , no. 6 (1954): 381–91.\\nto it. In other words, as the size of an object increases, the time to select it goes\\ndown. Additionally, the time to select an object decreases as the distance that a\\nuser must move to select it decreases. The opposite is true as well: the smaller\\nand further away an object is, the more time it takes to accurately select it. This\\nrather obvious concept has far-reaching implications, which we’ll unpack in this\\nchapter. We’ll also take a look at some supporting examples.\\nOrigins\\nThe origins of Fitts’s law can be traced back to 1954, when American psycholo-\\ngist Paul Fitts predicted that the time required to rapidly move to a target area\\nis a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the\\ntarget ( Figure 2-1). Today, Fitt’s law is regarded as one of the most successful\\nand influential mathematical models of human motion, and it’s widely used\\nin ergonomics and human–computer interaction  to model the act of pointing,\\neither physically or virtually.1\\nFigure 2-1. Diagram depicting Fitts’s law\\n16 | LAWS OF UX\\nFitts also proposed an index of difficulty metric to quantify the difficulty of a\\ntarget selection task in which the distance to the center of the target ( D) is like a\\nsignal and the tolerance or width of the target (W) is like noise:\\nID = log2\\n2D\\nW\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nThe Human Factor\\nThe American military was plagued with accidental deaths and crashes\\nduring World War II. In just one 22-month period of the war, the Air Force\\nreported an astounding 457 crashes, most of which were typically attrib-\\nuted to “pilot error. ” Paul Fitts was assigned by the Air Force to diagnose\\nthe cause and noticed that crash data was not random, which would\\nhave been expected if the root cause was “accident-prone” pilots. He\\nintuited that something was behind the reason for the crashes—some-\\nthing more than pilot error. Fitts and his colleague Alfonse Chapanis\\ninterviewed pilots regarding these crashes and discovered the cause: a\\nmajority were directly a result of pilots under duress confusing the flap\\nand landing gear controls, which looked identical to one another.\\nT o resolve this issue, Chapanis devised a system known as “shape\\ncoding”: differentiating knobs and levers with distinct shapes to make it\\neasy to distinguish the controls of the plane merely by feel. This would\\nhelp eliminate confusion, even under extreme conditions like flying in the\\ndark. In the process, they invented a new paradigm for viewing human\\nbehavior known as human factors. The premise for this new approach\\nemphasized the importance of designing machines that account for\\nhuman limitations and behavior, rather than assuming perfect conditions\\nand rationality. In other words, designing better machines meant figuring\\nout how people acted without thinking while they were distracted, con-\\nfused, or irrational as a result of stressful circumstances.\\nThe lessons learned by Fitts and Chapanis are invaluable to this very\\nday. The discovery that designing better technology meant adapting to\\nhumans and all our idiosyncrasies and limitations, rather than forcing us\\nto adapt to a rigid system that must be operated in a specific way, laid\\nthe foundation for what we know now as “human-centered design. ” It’s\\nFITTS’S LAW | 17\\na lesson that we must continuously remind ourselves of: to design bet-\\nter technology means to design for humans, and to design for humans\\nmeans to anticipate our emotions, limitations, and preconceptions.\\nExamples\\nFitts’s law was established as a model for understanding human movement in\\nthe physical world before the invention of the graphical user interface, but it can\\nalso be applied to movement through a digital interface. We can derive three\\nimportant guidelines from Fitts’s law. First, touch targets should be large enough\\nthat users can easily discern them and accurately select them. Second, touch\\ntargets should have ample space between them. Last, touch targets should be\\nplaced in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.\\nAs obvious as it might seem, touch target sizing is of vital importance:\\nwhen touch targets are too small, it takes users longer to engage them. The rec-\\nommended size varies ( Table 2-1), but all recommendations indicate awareness\\nof the importance of sizing.\\nTable 2-1. Minimum touch target size recommendations\\nCompany/Org Size\\nSpatial interfaces—Human Interface Guidelines (Apple) 60 × 60 pt\\nTouch interfaces—Human Interface Guidelines (Apple) 44 × 44 pt\\nMaterial Design guidelines (Google) 48 × 48 dp\\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 44 × 44 CSS px\\nNielsen Norman Group 1 × 1 cm\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that these recommendations are minimums.\\nDesigners should aim to exceed these target touch sizes whenever possible to\\ndecrease the need for precision. Adequate touch target size not only ensures\\ninteractive elements are easily selectable but also can reinforce users’ perception\\nthat the interface is easy to use. Small touch targets add to the perception that an\\ninterface is less usable, even if the user is able to avoid errors when attempting to\\nselect a target.\\n18 | LAWS OF UX\\n2 Kiran Dandekar, Balasundar I. Raju, and Mandayam A. Srinivasan, “3-D Finite-Element Models of Human\\nand Monkey Fingertips to Investigate the Mechanics of T actile Sense, ” Journal of Biomechanical Engi-\\nneering 125, no. 5 (2003): 682–91.\\n3 Steven Hoober, “Design for Fingers, T ouch, and People, Part 1, ” UXmatters, March 6, 2017 , https:/ /\\noreil.ly/piGSh.\\nAnother consideration that affects the usability of interactive elements is\\nthe spacing between them. When the space between elements is too small, the\\nlikelihood of touch target errors increases. The MIT Touch Lab conducted a\\nstudy that showed that the average adult human’s fingertips are 16–20 mm in\\ndiameter.2 It’s inevitable that a user will partially touch outside touch targets at\\nleast some of the time—and if additional touch targets are too close together,\\nthey might be accidentally selected, causing frustration and decreasing the user’s\\nperception of the interface’s usability. To mitigate the false activation that can\\nhappen when targets are too close, Google’s Material Design guidelines recom-\\nmend that “touch targets should be separated by 8dp [density-independent pixels]\\nof space or more to ensure balanced information density and usability.”\\nIn addition to sizing and spacing, the position of touch targets is key to how\\neasily selectable they are. Placing touch targets in areas of the screen that are\\nharder to reach will, in turn, make the targets harder to select. What isn’t always\\nobvious is where exactly these hard-to-reach areas of a screen are, as it changes\\ndepending on the context of the user, the device used, etc. Take smartphones,\\nfor instance, which come in a range of form factors and which people hold in a\\nvariety of ways depending on the task and availability of both hands. Some areas\\nof the screen can become difficult to reach when the user is holding the device\\nin one hand and using the thumb to select items, while holding the phone in\\none hand and selecting elements with the other greatly reduces this difficulty.\\nEven with one-handed use, accuracy does not increase linearly from the lower\\nright to the upper left of the screen; according to research by Steven Hoober, 3\\npeople prefer to view and touch the center of the smartphone screen, and this is\\nwhere accuracy is the highest ( Figure 2-2). They also tend to focus on the center\\nof the screen, as opposed to scanning from the upper left to the lower right as is\\ncommon on desktop devices.\\nFITTS’S LAW | 19\\nFigure 2-2. Smartphone touch accuracy (illustration based on research by Steven Hoober)\\nNext, let‘s look at a common example of Fitts’s law: form text labels. By\\nassociating a text label element with an input, designers and developers can\\nensure that taps or clicks on the label will perform the same function as selecting\\nthe input ( Figure 2-3 ). This native feature effectively expands the surface area\\nof the form input, making it easier for users to focus on the input with less\\nprecision. The net effect is a better user experience for desktop and mobile users\\nalike.\\nFigure 2-3. Touch target area on text label and form input\\n20 | LAWS OF UX\\nContinuing with forms, another common example of Fitts’s law can be\\nfound in the placement of form submission buttons. These buttons are usually\\npositioned in close proximity to the last form input ( Figure 2-4), because buttons\\nthat are intended to complete an action (such as filling out a form) should be\\nclose to the active element. This positioning not only ensures that the two types\\nof input are visually related but also ensures that the distance the user must\\ntravel from the last form input to the submission button is minimal.\\nFigure 2-4. Form submission buttons are placed in close proximity to the last form input\\nThe spacing between interactive elements is also an important consideration.\\nTake, for example, the connection request confirmation screen in LinkedIn’s iOS\\napp ( Figure 2-5), which places the “accept” and “deny” actions together on the\\nright side of a dialog. The actions are so close together that users must make a\\nsignificant effort to focus on selecting the action they wish to perform without\\naccidentally selecting the other. In fact, each time I see this screen I know it\\nmeans I have to switch to using two hands to avoid misselecting “accept” with\\nmy thumb.\\nSmartphones, laptops, and desktop computers aren’t the only interfaces we\\ninteract with on a daily basis. Take, for example, infotainment systems, which\\ncan be found in the vehicles many use every day. The Tesla Model 3 features a\\n15ʺ display mounted directly on the dashboard. Most of the vehicle’s controls are\\nlocated on this screen and do not provide haptic feedback when the user engages\\nwith them. This of course requires the driver to divert their attention from the\\nroad to the screen to access these controls, so Fitts’s law is of critical importance.\\nFITTS’S LAW | 21\\nFigure 2-5. Lack of ample space between actions increases the likelihood of accidental selection\\n(source: LinkedIn, 2023)\\nApple CarPlay follows Fitts’s law, providing ample space between interactive\\nelements (Figure 2-6). This mitigates the risk of accidental selection of adjacent\\nactions.\\nFigure 2-6. Providing sufficient space between items increases usability,\\nminimizing the chances of selecting the wrong action (source: Apple, 2023)\\n22 | LAWS OF UX\\nI mentioned thumb zones with regard to touch target positioning earlier,\\nand how positioning touch targets in hard-to-reach areas of the interface makes\\nthem harder to select. With the arrival of the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus,\\nApple introduced a feature that aimed to mitigate the difficulty of one-handed\\nuse. The feature, called Reachability, enables users to quickly bring items at\\nthe top of the screen down to the lower half of the screen via a simple gesture\\n(Figure 2-7). It effectively enables easy access to parts of the screen that would\\notherwise be difficult for one-handed users to interact with.\\nFigure 2-7. The iPhone’s Reachability feature enables easy access to the top half of the screen\\n(source: Apple, 2023)\\nFitts’s law can also be observed with infinite targets. There is no need to\\nworry about overshooting the target, as it doesn’t matter where the pointer stops\\nits movement, as long as the target area has been reached. The edges of the\\nscreen act as natural walls for the cursor, allowing users to reach targets on the\\nedge of the screen more easily. Consider example targets along the screen edge\\nFITTS’S LAW | 23\\nof desktop operating systems such as macOS ( Figure 2-8), where designers have\\ntaken advantage of infinite targets by placing the app bar along the bottom of the\\nscreen and the application menu at the top of the screen, making it easy for users\\nto access both quickly without slowing down to hit the options accurately.\\nFigure 2-8. The macOS app bar found at the bottom edge of the screen and the application menu\\nfound in the upper left edge are examples of infinite targets, which are easy for users to access\\nquickly without sacrificing accuracy (source: Apple, 2023)\\nFitts’s law isn’t limited to mouse or touch input. Spatial computing breaks\\noutside the constraints of screens and allows interfaces to occupy people’s phys-\\nical space. Focus with our eyes can be an additional means of signaling interac-\\ntional intent and can even become a means of targeting interaction elements.\\nTake, for example, Apple’s visionOS, which enables users to interact with the\\nsystem through a combination of input from their eyes and hand gestures (see\\nFigure 2-9). The time to acquire a target is optimized through placing primary\\ncontent within the center of the field of view relative to the user’s head and\\nkeeping interactive content at the same depth, minimizing neck and body move-\\nment and preventing the eyes from having to adapt to new spatial depth. Addi-\\ntionally, Apple recommends rounding interaction elements to increase precision\\nbecause sharp-edged target areas tend to focus our eyes to the edges, decreasing\\nprecision.\\n24 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 2-9. Apple’s visionOS recommends placing primary content within the center of the field\\nof view relative to the user’s head, keeping interactive content at the same depth, and rounding\\ninteractive elements (source: Apple, 2023)\\nTECHNIQUE\\nContextual Inquiry\\nFitts and Chapanis’s novel approach to understanding user behavior,\\nwhich we covered above, was an early form of contextual inquiry an eth-\\nnographic field study that involves in-depth observation and interviews\\nof a small sample of users in their natural environments in order to gain\\na robust understanding of work practices and behaviors. The goal of this\\napproach is to uncover hidden insights about the observed participants’\\nwork that may not be available through other research methods, such as\\nuser interviews alone. User interviews rely on the users’ ability to recall\\nand explain a process that they are removed from at that moment. In\\ncontrast, contextual inquiry allows for direct observation of the work as\\nit happens, providing a more accurate and detailed understanding of the\\nprocess.\\nPrimer\\nT o ease the participant into the session, begin by introducing your-\\nself, stating the goals of the inquiry, and communicating what the\\nparticipant can expect.

Let the\\nuser know that you will watch while they work and may interrupt\\nto discuss interesting observations. Also let them know that if it’s a\\nbad time for interruption, they can communicate this to you.\\nOnce the interview begins, follow a process of watching and\\nlearning, then initiating discussion when needed. Be sure to watch\\nand learn while stopping the participant to discuss observations\\nthat you’d like to explore further or clarify. Ask open-ended ques-\\ntions that let the participant give you details about why they took a\\ncertain action. The focus is on understanding underlying processes\\nand external resources being used. Standard steps and uncommon\\nvariations should be discussed, and interpretations of tasks and\\nworkflows should be confirmed or corrected by the user. It’s a good\\nidea to avoid asking participants to validate your interpretations too\\noften as it may bias their future behaviors, but remember them for\\nthe final phase of the interview.\\nWrapping up\\nEnd by asking any clarifying questions and summarizing your inter-\\npretation of the observed processes in order to get final clarifica-\\ntions and correct your understanding. Be sure to review your notes\\nand summarize what you understood from the interview. This is\\nan opportunity for your users to correct and clarify any misunder-\\nstandings about the observed processes.\\nConclusion\\nA key responsibility we have as designers is to ensure the interfaces we create\\naugment human capabilities and experiences and don’t distract from or deter\\nthem. Mobile interfaces are especially susceptible to Fitts’s law due to the limited\\nscreen real estate available and the relative inaccuracy of fingers compared to\\na mouse. We can ensure interactive elements are easily selectable by making\\nthem large enough for users to discern and accurately select them, providing\\nample space between controls to avoid accidental selection of adjacent actions,\\nand placing the controls in areas of the UI that allow them to be easily selected.\\n26 | LAWS OF UX\\n\\n\\nMiller’s Law\\nThe average person can keep only 7 (± 2) items in their working memory.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process,•\\nunderstand, and memorize easily.\\n• Remember that short-term memory capacity will vary per•\\nindividual, based on their prior knowledge and situational context.\\n• Don’t use the “magical number seven” to justify unnecessary•\\ndesign limitations.\\nOverview\\nIt’s likely that many designers will have heard of Miller’s law, but there is also\\na high probability that their understanding of it is inaccurate.

While there is value in limiting the number of options\\navailable to users (see Chapter 4, “Hick’s Law” ), it is misleading and inaccurate\\nto attribute such dogma to Miller’s law. In this chapter, we’ll explore the origins\\nof Miller’s “magical number seven” and the real value Miller’s law has to provide\\nto UX designers.\\n29\\n| 3\\n1 George A. Miller, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus T wo: Some Limits on Our Capacity for\\nProcessing Information, ” Psychological Review 63, no. 2 (1956): 81–97 .\\nOrigins\\nMiller’s law originates from a paper published in 1956 by cognitive psychologist\\nGeorge Miller titled “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some\\nLimits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.” 1 Miller, a professor at\\nHarvard University’s Department of Psychology, discussed in his paper the coin-\\ncidence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits\\nof short-term memory. Miller observed that memory span in young adults was\\napproximately limited to 7, regardless of the stimuli, even if the stimuli consis-\\nted of vastly different amounts of information. This led him to the conclusion\\nthat bits, the basic unit of information, don’t affect memory span as much as\\nthe number of information chunks being memorized. The term “chunks” in\\ncognitive psychology refers to collections of basic familiar units that have been\\ngrouped together and stored in a person’s memory.\\nMiller’s paper is often interpreted as arguing that the number of objects an\\naverage human can hold in short-term memory is 7 ± 2. Miller himself only used\\nthe expression “the magical number seven” rhetorically and was surprised by its\\nfrequent misinterpretation. Later research on short-term memory and working\\nmemory revealed that memory span is not a constant, even when measured in\\n“chunks.”\\nMiller was an early pioneer in recognizing that the human mind can be\\nunderstood using an information-processing model and that our working mem-\\nory capacity has inherent limits. His insights helped move psychological research\\nbeyond the behaviorist methods that had dominated the field through the 1950s\\nand laid the foundation for an important concept: cognitive load theory.\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT\\nCognitive Load\\nWhen engaging with a digital product or service, a user must first learn\\nhow it works and then determine how to find the information they are\\nlooking for. Understanding how to use the navigation (and sometimes\\neven finding it), processing the page layout, interacting with UI elements,\\nand entering information into forms all require mental resources. While\\n30 | LAWS OF UX\\n2 John Sweller, “Cognitive Load During Problem Solving: Effects on Learning, ” Cognitive Science 12, no. 2\\n(1988): 257–85.\\nthis learning process is happening, the user must also maintain focus on\\nwhat they intended to do in the first place, which, depending on how easy\\nan interface is to use, can be quite a challenge. The amount of mental\\nresources needed to understand and interact with an interface is known\\nas cognitive load.2\\nY ou can think of it like memory in a phone or laptop: run too many\\napps and the battery begins to drain, and the device slows down, or\\nworst of all, it crashes. The amount of processing power available deter-\\nmines performance, and this depends on memory—a finite resource.\\nOur brains work similarly: when the amount of information coming\\nin exceeds the space we have available, we struggle mentally to keep\\nup—tasks become more difficult, details are missed, and we begin to\\nfeel overwhelmed. Our working memory, the buffer space (Figure 3-1)\\navailable for storing information relevant to the current task, has a spe-\\ncific number of slots in which to store information. If the tasks at hand\\nrequire more space than is available, we begin to lose information from\\nour working memory to accommodate this new information.\\nFigure 3-1. Working memory buffer illustration\\nThis becomes problematic when the information lost is critical to\\nthe task that someone wishes to perform or is related to the information\\nthey want to find. T asks will become more difficult and users might start\\nto feel overwhelmed, ultimately leading to frustration or even task aban-\\ndonment—both symptoms of a bad user experience.\\nMILLER’S LAW | 31\\nTECHNIQUE\\nChunking\\nMiller’s fascination with short-term memory and memory span centered\\nnot on the number seven but on the concept of chunking and our abil-\\nity to memorize information accordingly. He found that the size of the\\nchunks did not seem to matter—seven individual words could be held\\nin short-term memory as easily as seven individual letters. While there\\nare factors that influence how many chunks a given individual can retain\\n(context, familiarity with the content, specific capacity), the takeaway is\\nthe same: human short-term memory is limited, and chunking helps us\\nretain information more effectively.\\nWhen applied to UX design, chunking informs an incredibly valuable\\napproach to content. When we chunk content in design, we are effec-\\ntively making it easier to comprehend. We can apply chunking by group-\\ning related content and objects together and using design elements such\\nas color, scale, dividers, and spacing to make these groups visually dis-\\ntinctive from other groups. Users can then scan the content, identify the\\ninformation that aligns with their goal(s), and consume that information\\nto achieve their goal(s) more quickly. By structuring content into visually\\ndistinct groups with a clear hierarchy, we can align the information we\\npresent with how people evaluate and process digital content.\\nExamples\\nThe simplest example of chunking can be found in how we format phone\\nnumbers. Without chunking, a phone number would just be a long string of\\ndigits—sometimes significantly more than seven numbers—making it difficult\\nto process and remember. A phone number that has been formatted (chunked) is\\nmuch easier to both process and memorize (Figure 3-2).\\n32 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 3-2. A (US) phone number with and without chunking applied\\nLet’s move on to a slightly more complex example. When browsing the web,\\nyou’ll inevitably be faced with the dreaded “wall of text” ( Figure 3-3 )—content\\nthat’s characterized by a lack of hierarchy or formatting and that exceeds the\\nappropriate line length. It can be compared to the unformatted phone number\\nexample just given, but on a larger scale. This content is more difficult to scan\\nand process, which has the effect of increasing the cognitive load on users.\\nFigure 3-3. “Wall of text” example (source: Wikipedia, 2019)\\nWhen we compare this example with content that has formatting, hierarchy,\\nand appropriate line lengths applied, the contrast is significant. Figure 3-4 is an\\nimproved version of the same content. Headings and subheadings have been\\nadded to provide hierarchy, whitespace has been used to break the content into\\ndiscernible sections, line length has been reduced to improve readability, text\\nlinks have been underlined, and key words have been highlighted to provide\\ncontrast with the surrounding text.\\nMILLER’S LAW | 33\\nFigure 3-4. “Wall of text” improved with hierarchy, formatting, and appropriate line lengths\\n(source: Wikipedia, 2019)\\nNow let’s take a look at how chunking is applied in a broader context.\\nChunking can be used to help users understand underlying relationships by\\ngrouping content into distinctive modules, applying rules to separate content,\\nand providing hierarchy ( Figure 3-5). Especially in an information-dense experi-\\nence, chunking can be leveraged to provide structure to the content. Not only is\\nthe result more visually pleasing, but it’s also more scannable. Users who are\\nskimming the latest headlines to determine which is worthy of their attention\\ncan quickly scan the page and make a decision.\\nFigure 3-5. Example of chunking applied to dense information (source: Bloomberg, 2023)\\n34 | LAWS OF UX\\nWhile chunking is incredibly useful for bringing order to information-dense\\nexperiences, it can be found in many other places as well. Take, for example,\\necommerce websites such as Nike.com (Figure 3-6 ), which uses chunking to\\ngroup information related to each product. While individual elements might\\nnot share a background or surrounding border, they are visually chunked by\\ntheir proximity to one another (product image, title, price, type of product, and\\nfinally total colors available). Additionally, Nike.com leverages chunking to group\\nrelated filters in the lefthand sidebar.\\nFigure 3-6. Chunking is commonly used to group products and filters on ecommerce websites\\n(source: Nike.com, 2023)\\nChunking can also be used to group related actions or functions together\\nwithin the same space, thus creating a relationship among the grouped items\\nand differentiating them from other groupings. This is especially true for tool-\\nbars in editing programs like Google Docs ( Figure 3-7), which utilizes chunking\\nto separate functionality within the toolbar into discernible groups.\\nFigure 3-7. Google Docs utilizes chunking to separate functions into discernible groups\\n(source: Google Docs, 2023)\\nMILLER’S LAW | 35\\nThese examples demonstrate how chunking can be used to visually organize\\nany content for easier comprehension. It helps those who are consuming the\\ncontent to understand the underlying relationships and information hierarchy.\\nWhat chunking does not do is dictate a specific limit on the number of items that\\ncan be shown at a given time or within a group. Rather, it’s simply a method for\\norganizing content that makes it easier to quickly identify important information.\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nThe “Magical” Number Seven\\nMiller’s law is occasionally misunderstood to mean that there is a spe-\\ncific limit to the number of items that can be stored and processed\\nin short-term memory at one time (7 ± 2), and that the number of\\nrelated interface elements should therefore be limited to this range. A\\ncommon example in regard to which this law is mistakenly cited is that\\nof adjacent elements such as navigation links. Perhaps you’ve heard\\nsomeone mention in the past that navigation links must be limited to\\nseven, citing Miller’s law as the justification. In reality, design patterns\\nsuch as navigation menus don’t require people to memorize them—the\\nchoices available to them via the navigation menu are visible at all times.\\nIn other words, there’s no usability gain provided by limiting these links\\nto a specific number. As long as the menu is designed effectively, users\\nwill be able to quickly identify the relevant link—the only memorization\\nnecessary is what their actual goal is.\\nWe’ll return to Nike.com and examine the primary navigation menu\\n(Figure 3-8) to see an example. As you can see, the navigation links\\nnumber well beyond seven, yet it is still easy to scan the list thanks to\\nclear categorization and the use of whitespace and vertical dividers to\\nseparate sub-groupings.\\n36 | LAWS OF UX\\n3 Nelson Cowan, “The Magical Number 4 in Short-T erm Memory: A Reconsideration of Mental Storage\\nCapacity, ” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 24, no. 1 (2001): 87–114.\\n4 Wei Ji Ma, Masud Husain, and Paul M. Bays, “Changing Concepts of Working Memory, ” Nature Neuro-\\nscience 17 , no. 3 (2014): 347–56.\\nFigure 3-8. Despite not limiting menu items to seven, the navigation on Nike.com\\nis easily comprehensible (source: Nike.com, 2023)\\nMiller’s findings were centered around the limitations of short-term memory\\nand how it can be optimized by organizing bits of information into meaningful\\nchunks. The actual limit to the number of chunks that can be stored will vary\\nper individual based on their knowledge of the information and the complexity\\nof the information. There is research that suggests the average limit is closer to\\nfour items for short-term memory capacity, 3 and other prominent theories argue\\nagainst measuring capacity in terms of a fixed number of elements altogether.4\\nConclusion\\nThe sheer volume of information around us is growing at an exponential rate—\\nbut we humans have a finite amount of mental resources available to process\\nthat information. The inevitable overload that can occur has a direct effect on\\nour ability to complete tasks. Miller’s law teaches us to use chunking to organize\\ncontent into smaller clusters to help users process, understand, and memorize\\neasily.\\nMILLER’S LAW | 37\\n\\nHick’s Law\\nThe time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and\\ncomplexity of choices available.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• Minimize choices when response times are critical to decrease•\\ndecision time.\\n• Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease•\\nmental effort.\\n• Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options.•\\n• Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.•\\nOverview\\nOne of the primary functions we have as designers is to synthesize informa-\\ntion and present it in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the people who use the\\nproducts and services we design. We do this because we understand, almost\\ninstinctively, that redundancy and excessiveness create confusion. This confusion\\nis problematic when it comes to creating products and services that feel intuitive.\\nInstead we should enable people to quickly and easily accomplish their goals.\\nWe risk causing confusion when we don’t completely understand the goals and\\nconstraints of the people using the product or service. Ultimately, our objective\\nis to understand what the user seeks to accomplish so that we can reduce or\\neliminate anything that doesn’t contribute to them successfully achieving their\\n39\\n| 4\\ngoal(s). We, in essence, strive to simplify complexity through efficiency and\\nelegance.\\nWhat is neither efficient nor elegant is when an interface provides too many\\noptions. This is a clear indication that those who created the product or service\\ndo not entirely understand the needs of the user. Complexity extends beyond\\njust the user interface; it can be applied to processes as well. The absence of a\\ndistinctive and clear call to action, unclear information architecture, unnecessary\\nsteps, too many choices or too much information—all of these can be obstacles to\\nusers seeking to perform a specific task.\\nThis observation directly relates to Hick’s law, which predicts that the time\\nit takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices\\navailable. Not only is this principle fundamental to decision making, but it’s also\\ncritical to how people perceive and process the user interfaces we create. We’ll\\nlook at some examples of how this principle relates to design, but first let’s look\\nat its origins.\\nOrigins\\nHick’s law was formulated in 1952 by psychologists William Edmund Hick\\nand Ray Hyman, who were examining the relationship between the number\\nof stimuli present and an individual’s reaction time to any given stimulus. What\\nthey found was that increasing the number of choices available logarithmically\\nincreases decision time. In other words, people take longer to make a decision\\nwhen given more options to choose from. It turns out there is an actual formula\\nto represent this relationship: RT = a + b log2 (n) (Figure 4-1). This formula\\ncalculates response time (RT) based on the number of stimuli present ( n) and\\ntwo arbitrary measurable constants that depend on the task (a, b).\\nFortunately, we don’t need to understand the math behind this formula to\\ngrasp what it means. The concept is straightforward when applied to design:\\nthe time it takes for users to interact with an interface directly correlates to the\\nnumber of options available to interact with. This implies that complex or busy\\ninterfaces result in longer decision times for users, because the users must first\\nprocess the options that are available to them and then choose which is most\\nrelevant in relation to their goal. When an interface is too busy, actions are\\nunclear or difficult to identify, and critical information is hard to find, the mental\\neffort required to find what we are looking for increases. This increase in mental\\neffort is commonly referred to as cognitive load, which we covered in Chapter 3,\\n“Miller’s Law”.\\n40 | LAWS OF UX\\n1 “Why Do We Have a Harder Time Choosing When We Have More Options?, ” The Decision Lab, August 16,\\n2018, https:/ /oreil.ly/mmpYT.\\n2 Barry Schwartz, The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less (New Y ork: HarperCollins, 2004).\\nFigure 4-1. Diagram representing Hick’s law\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPTS\\nParadox of Choice\\nHave you ever noticed it’s easy to get indecisive and overwhelmed with\\nthe more choices you have? T ake, for example, a restaurant menu with a\\nplethora of food and beverage options. This menu will inherently require\\nmore mental energy to process and decide on an option in comparison to\\na menu that’s focused around a dozen or so items. Despite the common\\nassumption that the more choice we have the better, the opposite is\\noften true: more choice leads to choice overload.1\\nThis is the paradox of choice: the range of choices that is available\\ntoday for virtually anything is far greater than in the past, but still, people\\nare not happier.2 The paradox was popularized by American psychologist\\nBarry Schwartz and relates the ideas of psychologist Herbert A. Simon\\nfrom the 1950s to the psychological stress that most consumers face\\ntoday.\\nHICK’S LAW | 41\\n3 Sheena S. Iyengar and Mark R. Lepper, “When Choice Is Demotivating: Can One Desire T oo Much of a Good\\nThing?, ” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 79, no. 6 (2000): 995–1006.\\nSchwartz was inspired by a study conducted by psychologists\\nSheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper in 2000 that challenged the implicit\\nassumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically\\nmotivating than having fewer.3 In the experiment, shoppers at an upscale\\nfood market were presented with a display table showcasing 24 varieties\\nof gourmet jam. Those who sampled the different spreads received a\\ncoupon offering a small discount on any jam purchase. On another day,\\nshoppers encountered a similar table, but this time only six varieties\\nof jam were on display. The larger display captured more attention\\ncompared to the smaller one. However, when it came time to make a\\npurchase, individuals who saw the larger display were only one-tenth as\\nlikely to buy compared to those who saw the smaller display. In other\\nwords, shoppers were more likely to make a purchase when presented\\nwith a limited choice of gourmet jams compared to a larger selection.\\nExamples\\nNow that we have an understanding of Hick’s law, let’s take a look at some\\nexamples that demonstrate this principle. There are examples of Hick’s law in\\naction everywhere, but we’ll start with a common one: remote controls.\\nAs the number of features available in TVs increased over the decades, so\\ndid the options available on their corresponding remotes. Eventually, we ended\\nup with remotes so complex that using them required either muscle memory\\nfrom repeated use or a significant amount of mental processing. This led to the\\nphenomenon known as “grandparent-friendly remotes.” By taping off everything\\nexcept for the essential buttons, grandkids were able to improve the usability of\\nremotes for their loved ones, and they also did us all the favor of sharing the\\nmodified remotes online (Figure 4-2).\\nIn contrast, today we have smart TV remotes: the streamlined cousins of the\\nprevious examples, with the controls simplified to only those that are absolutely\\nnecessary (Figure 4-3). The result is a remote that doesn’t require a substantial\\namount of mental energy. The complexity is transferred to the TV interface\\nitself, where information can be effectively organized and progressively disclosed\\nwithin menus.\\n42 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 4-2. Modified TV remotes that simplify the “interface”\\n(sources: Sam Weller via Twitter, 2015 [left]; Luke Hannon via Twitter, 2016 [right])\\nFigure 4-3. A smart TV remote, which simplifies the controls to only those absolutely necessary\\n(source: Apple, 2023)\\nHICK’S LAW | 43\\nNow that we’ve looked at some examples of Hick’s law at work in the physi-\\ncal world, let’s shift our focus to the digital. As we’ve seen already, the number of\\nchoices available can have a direct impact on the time it takes to make a decision.\\nWe can ensure better user experiences by providing the right choices at the right\\ntime rather than presenting all the possible choices all the time. An excellent\\nexample of this can be found with Google Search, which provides the varying\\nmeans of filtering results by type (all, images, videos, news, etc.) only after you’ve\\nbegun your search ( Figure 4-4). This helps to keep people focused on the more\\nmeaningful task at hand, rather than being overwhelmed with decisions at the\\noutset.\\nFigure 4-4. Google simplifies the initial task of searching (left) and provides the ability to filter\\nresults only after the search has begun (right) (source: Google, 2023)\\nLet’s look at another example of Hick’s law. Onboarding is a crucial but\\nrisky process for new users, and few applications nail it as well as Notion ( Fig-\\nure 4-5). Notion helps beginners learn the basics of its product by providing an\\neasy-to-follow checklist for getting started. This is an effective way to onboard\\nusers because it mimics the way we actually learn: we often learn best by doing\\nand building upon what we already know. By providing steps in a risk-free envi-\\nronment, we can enable new users to start interacting with an app without them\\nfeeling overwhelmed by an endless amount of possibilities for getting started.\\n44 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 4-5. Screenshot from Notion’s progressive onboarding experience (source: Notion, 2023)\\nAnother common example of Hick’s law in action can be found with stream-\\ning services and the choices we’re presented when deciding on what to watch.\\nTake, for example, Netflix, which found that its customers took an average of\\n18 minutes to find a show or movie. The reason for this was they were often\\nparalyzed with indecision when it came to selecting a show or movie based on\\nthe quantity of options in front of them. To help remedy this, Netflix introduced\\nvarious features such as “Trending Now” and “Popular on Netflix” (Figure 4-6)\\nas ways to provide more weight to specific options through the social proof that\\nothers have enjoyed them.\\nFigure 4-6. Netflix’s “Trending Now” and “Popular on Netflix” sections provide more weight to\\nspecific options via social proof (source: Netflix, 2023)\\nHICK’S LAW | 45\\nTECHNIQUE\\nCard Sorting\\nAs we’ve seen in the previous examples, the number of choices can have\\na critical impact on the time it takes for people to make a decision. This is\\nespecially important when it comes to enabling users to find the informa-\\ntion they need. T oo many items can lead to more cognitive load for users,\\nespecially if the choices aren’t clear. Conversely, with too few choices it\\nbecomes more difficult for users to identify which item is most likely to\\nlead them to the information they’re looking for. One particularly useful\\nmethod for identifying users’ expectations when it comes to information\\narchitecture is card sorting. This handy research method is great for\\nfiguring out how items should be organized according to people’s mental\\nmodels: simply have the participants organize topics within groups that\\nmake the most sense to them (Figure 4-7).\\nFigure 4-7. Card sorting\\nThe steps required during this exercise are relatively straightforward.\\nWhile there are a variety of approaches to card sorting (closed versus\\nopen, moderated versus unmoderated), they all follow the same general\\n46 | LAWS OF UX\\n4 In a closed exercise, the groups are predefined by the researcher.\\n5 Jakob Nielsen, “Card Sorting: Pushing Users Beyond T erminology Matches, ” Nielsen Norman Group,\\nAugust 23, 2009, https:/ /oreil.ly/bxhNN.\\nprocess. The following are the steps that make up a moderated open\\ncard sorting exercise,4 which is the most common type:\\n1. Identify topics\\nThe first step is to identify the topics that the participants will be\\nasked to organize. These topics should represent the main content\\nwithin your information architecture, with each item written on an\\nindividual card (the exercise can also be conducted digitally). It’s\\nrecommended that you avoid labeling topics with the same words,\\nwhich can bias participants and lead them to group these items\\ntogether.5\\n2. Organize topics\\nThe next step is to have the participants organize the topics, one\\nat a time, into groupings that make sense to them. It’s common\\nto have participants think out loud during this phase, which can\\nprovide valuable insight into their thought processes.\\n3. Name categories\\nOnce the topics have been organized into groups, ask the partici-\\npants to name each group they created based on the term they\\nthink best describes it. This step is particularly valuable because it\\nreveals what each participant’s mental model is and will be helpful\\nwhen determining what to eventually label categories within your\\ninformation architecture.\\n4. Debrief participants (optional)\\nThe optional but recommended final step during an open card sort-\\ning exercise is to ask the participants to explain their rationale for\\neach of the groupings they created. This enables you to uncover\\nwhy each participant made the decisions they did, identify any dif-\\nficulties they experienced, and gather their thoughts on any topics\\nthat might have remained unsorted.\\nHICK’S LAW | 47\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nOversimplification\\nAn important goal for designers is to eliminate unnecessary complexity\\nfor the users  of the products and services they design—to become\\nelegant simplifiers. After all, good user experiences are often those that\\nfeel easy and intuitive, and where obstructions that might deter people\\nfrom achieving their goals have been removed. As we’ve seen, simplifying\\nan interface or process helps to reduce the cognitive load for users and\\nincreases the likelihood that they’ll complete their task and achieve their\\ngoal. But a balance must be struck when striving for simplicity, and it’s\\nimportant not to take simplification too far. When an interface has been\\nsimplified to the point of abstraction, it’s no longer clear what actions are\\navailable, what the next steps are, or where to find specific information.\\nIn other words, the amount of visual information presented has been\\nreduced to make the interface seem less complex, but this has led to a\\nlack of sufficient cues to help guide people through a process or to the\\ninformation they need. As a result, the amount of cognitive load required\\nfor users to achieve their goals has increased.\\nA common example of this is the use of iconography as a way to\\ncommunicate critical information about possible actions (Figure 4-8).\\nUsing icons has a lot of advantages: they provide visual interest, they\\nsave space, they present excellent targets for taps or clicks, and they can\\nprovide quick recognition if they hold universal meaning. The challenge is\\nthat truly universal icons are rare, and icons often mean different things\\nto different people. While relying on icons to convey information can help\\nto simplify an interface, it can also make it harder to perform tasks or\\nfind information. This is especially true if the icons aren’t immediately\\nrecognizable to users, who more often than not will have a wide spec-\\ntrum of knowledge and experience.\\n48 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 4-8. Screenshot of the app bar from Facebook’s iOS app\\n(source: Facebook, 2023)\\nAnother complicating factor is that similar icons may be used to\\nrepresent different actions or information, sometimes in complete oppo-\\nsition, from one product or service to another. There is no icon standardi-\\nzation body that regulates what icons can be used where in websites or\\napps, which means that how icons are used is left to the discretion of the\\ndesigners and their teams. We know that an icon can represent different\\nthings to different people, but what about when the same icon represents\\ndifferent actions? Since there is no standardization, the functionality\\nattached to an icon can vary from one digital experience to another.\\nT ake, for example, the “heart” and “star” icons: they typically indicate the\\nability to favorite, like, bookmark, or rate an item, but they may some-\\ntimes simply indicate a featured item. Not only does the meaning and\\nfunctionality of these two icons vary across different products and serv-\\nices, but they also often compete with each other. This obviously results\\nin confusion and an increase in the cognitive load on users, because the\\nicons’ meaning is hard to interpret precisely.\\nAdding contextual clues helps users to identify the options that are\\nopen to them and the relevance of the information available to the tasks\\nthey wish to perform. In the case of iconography, studies have shown\\nthat simply adding text labels to accompany icons will provide clarity\\nand aid users with both discovery and recognition. This practice is even\\nmore critical when using icons for important elements such as navigation\\n(Figure 4-9). The addition of text labels effectively reduces the abstrac-\\ntion of the icons alone by including additional information to help convey\\nmeaning and increase usability.\\nHICK’S LAW | 49\\nFigure 4-9. Text labels accompany icons in the navigation\\non the X (formerly Twitter) web app (source: X, 2023)\\nConclusion\\nHick’s law is a key concept in user experience design because it’s an underlying\\nfactor in everything we do. When an interface is too busy, actions are unclear\\nor difficult to identify, and critical information is hard to find, a higher cognitive\\nload is placed on users. Simplifying an interface or process helps to reduce the\\nmental strain, but we must be sure to add contextual clues to help users identify\\nthe options available and determine the relevance of the information available to\\nthe tasks they wish to perform. It’s important to remember that each user has a\\ngoal, whether it’s to buy a product, understand something, or simply learn more\\nabout the content. I find the process of reduction, or eliminating any element\\nthat isn’t helping the user achieve their goal, a critical part of the design process.\\nThe less they have to think about what they need to do to reach their goal, the\\nmore likely it is they will achieve it.\\n50 | LAWS OF UX\\n\\n\\nPostel’s Law\\nBe conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various•\\nactions the user could take or any input they might provide.\\n• Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and•\\ncapability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.\\n• The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more•\\nresilient the design will be.\\n• Accept variable input from users, translating that input to meet•\\nyour requirements, defining boundaries for input, and providing\\nclear feedback to each user.\\nOverview\\nDesigning good user experiences means designing good human experiences.\\nPeople don’t behave like machines: we are sometimes inconsistent, frequently\\ndistracted, occasionally error-prone, and usually driven by emotion. We expect\\nthe products and services we interact with to intuitively understand us and be\\nforgiving. We expect to feel in control at all times, and we’re generally annoyed\\nwhen asked to provide more information than is necessary. At the same time, the\\ndevices and software we use vary greatly in terms of feature support, capabilities,\\nand form factors. To be capable of meeting users’ expectations, the products\\n53\\n| 5\\n1 Jon Postel, “RFC 793: T ransmission Control Protocol, ” September 1981, https:/ /oreil.ly/uxMIB.\\nand services designers build must be robust and adaptable. Postel’s law, also\\nknown as the robustness principle, gives us a guiding principle for designing\\nhuman-centric experiences that account for both scale and complexity. \\nThe first half of Postel’s law states that you should “ be conservative in what\\nyou do.” In the context of design, this can be interpreted as stipulating that the\\noutput of our efforts, whether that’s an interface or a comprehensive system,\\nshould be reliable and accessible. These are important characteristics of a digital\\nproduct or service, because not only must the interface be easy to use, but it must\\nbe easy to use for the largest spectrum of users possible. This means that anyone,\\nregardless of device size, feature support, input mechanism, assistive technology,\\nor even connection speed, should be served something that works.\\nThe second half of the principle states that you should “ be liberal in what\\nyou accept from others. ” In the context of design, this can be taken to mean the\\nacceptance of input from users via any input mechanism and in a variety of\\npossible formats. It applies to data entered into a form via mouse and keyboard\\n(or perhaps keyboard only), assistive technology, touch and gesture input from\\nmobile users, and even voice input in all its variations of language, dialect, and\\nnomenclature. It applies to screens of any size and resolution, from a watch\\ninterface all the way up to a TV. It encompasses differences in network band-\\nwidth, connection strength, and any other possible variation.\\nIn this chapter, we’ll take a close look at some examples of Postel’s law\\nin action and how designers can leverage this principle to design products and\\nservices that adapt to how people actually are.\\nOrigins\\nJon Postel was an American computer scientist who made significant contribu-\\ntions to the underlying protocols that would come to form the internet. One\\nof these contributions was an early implementation of the Transmission Con-\\ntrol Protocol (TCP), the foundation on which data is sent and received over a\\nnetwork. In this specification, Postel introduced what he called the robustness\\nprinciple, which stated that “TCP implementations will follow a general principle\\nof robustness: be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from\\nothers.”1 The idea was that programs that send data (either to other machines or\\nto different programs on the same machine) should conform to specifications,\\n54 | LAWS OF UX\\nwhile programs that receive data should be robust enough to accept and parse\\nnonconformant input, as long as the meaning is clear.\\nPostel’s principle was originally intended to be a guideline for network engi-\\nneering, specifically in regard to the transfer of data across computer networks.\\nThe fault tolerance introduced by the robustness principle helped to ensure\\nnodes on the early internet could communicate reliably, but its influence extends\\nbeyond just computer network engineering—software architecture has also been\\ninfluenced by this principle. Take, for example, declarative languages such as\\nHTML and CSS. Their loose error handling means that problems like authoring\\nmistakes or lack of browser support for specific features are handled gracefully\\nby the browser. If the browser doesn’t understand something, it simply ignores\\nit and moves on. This has lent an amazing amount of flexibility to these lan-\\nguages—flexibility that led to their dominance on the internet stage.\\nThe philosophy outlined in Postel’s law can also be applied to user experi-\\nence design and how we deal with user input and system output. As I mentioned\\nearlier, designing good user experiences means designing good human experien-\\nces. We are not always perfectly rational or attentive and can be easily distracted,\\nconfused, and irrational, especially when under stress. This means we can pre-\\ndict but must not assume things about where users are, how they work, and the\\ntechnology they use. Since humans and computers communicate and process\\ninformation in fundamentally different ways, it’s the responsibility of design to\\nbridge the communication gap. Let’s take a look at some examples to see how\\nthis can be done.\\nExamples\\nPostel’s law describes an approach to design that’s more akin to the philosophy\\nof human–computer interaction: we should anticipate virtually anything in terms\\nof input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.\\nThere are countless examples that demonstrate this philosophical approach, but\\nwe’ll begin with one that is ubiquitous in the digital world: input forms. Forms\\nhave long been a primary means for people to provide information to systems in\\nthe digital space. In essence, they are the medium through which humans and\\nsystems interact: a product or service requires information, and the user provides\\nthat information by way of form elements that are submitted for processing.\\nUsing Postel’s law as a guide in regard to forms, the first consideration is to\\nbe conservative in how much information you ask people to provide. The more\\nfields you require users to fill out, the more cognitive energy and effort you’re\\nPOSTEL’S LAW | 55\\n2 “Why Do We Make Worse Decisions at the End of the Day?, ” The Decision Lab, August 15, 2019, https:/ /\\noreil.ly/0qEbe.\\nasking of them, which can lead to a deterioration in the quality of the decisions\\nmade (commonly referred to as decision fatigue2) and reduce the likelihood that\\nthey’ll complete the form. By asking only for what’s absolutely necessary and\\nnot requesting information you already have, such as an email address or a\\npassword, you can minimize the effort required to fill out a form.\\nAnother consideration in regard to forms is their restrictiveness and what\\nthey require from users. Take, for example, the order of given name and family\\nname, which can change depending on the cultural norms. It can be confusing\\nto ask users within cultures accustomed to seeing family name first to fill out a\\nform requiring their given name first, which is the norm in Western cultures.\\nStrict formatting rules can also be an issue for addresses that don’t conform to\\na standard country/region, state/territory/province, zip/postal code format. It’s\\nalso important to consider formatting differences that could break form valida-\\ntion if it’s too restrictive, like including hyphenated names, names with spaces in\\nthem, or names with just one or two letters. Lastly, how we respond when there\\nis an error on form inputs should be carefully considered; telling someone their\\nname is “wrong” or “not accepted” can do a lot of damage to their experience and\\nsatisfaction with the product or service.\\nThere’s also the consideration of how flexible the system is with respect\\nto user input. Since humans and computers communicate in different ways,\\nthere’s sometimes a disconnect between the information that humans provide\\nand the information that the computer expects. Postel’s law dictates that comput-\\ners should be robust enough to accept varying types of human input and not only\\nmake sense of it but also process it into a computer-readable format. This can\\nbe done in a variety of ways, but perhaps most exciting are the ones that require\\nthe least amount of effort. Take, for example, Apple’s Face ID ( Figure 5-1 ), a\\nfacial recognition system that enables Apple users to authenticate on their mobile\\ndevices without the need to provide a username or a password each time they\\nattempt to unlock their devices.\\n56 | LAWS OF UX\\n3 Ethan Marcotte, “Responsive Web Design, ” A List Apart, May 25, 2010, https:/ /oreil.ly/RYGX0.\\nFigure 5-1. Face ID lets you securely unlock your iPhone or iPad, authenticate purchases, sign in\\nto apps, and more (source: Apple, 2023)\\nNext, let’s look at an example that has become ubiquitous in the post-desktop\\nera of computing: responsive design. Over the past few decades, as more and more\\ndevices gained the ability to connect to the web, the need to serve content that\\ncould adapt to any screen size increased. Ethan Marcotte introduced an approach\\nin 2010 that he called “responsive web design,” which relies on “fluid grids,\\nflexible images, and media queries” 3 to create websites that allow content to\\nrespond in a fluid manner to different viewing contexts. It was a completely new\\napproach to designing and building websites, at a time when the predominant\\nstrategy was to create separate websites for desktops and internet-capable mobile\\ndevices. Responsive web design pushed designers beyond creating device-specific\\nexperiences and toward an approach that embraced the fluid nature of the web.\\nThe growing capability of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) enabled designers to\\ndefine how content could flexibly adapt to any viewing context, be it an internet-\\ncapable smartwatch, smartphone, gaming console, laptop, desktop computer, or\\nTV ( Figure 5-2 ). Today, responsive web design is the de facto standard when\\ncreating web experiences, and it embodies the philosophy of accepting a broad\\nspectrum of input while providing output that is reliably adaptable and not\\nquarantined to specific dimensions or devices.\\nPOSTEL’S LAW | 57\\nFigure 5-2. Responsive web design embraces the fluid nature of the web\\nProgressive enhancement, which describes a strategy for web design focusing\\non content and a gradual layering of styling and interaction, can also be consid-\\nered an example of Postel’s law. First introduced by Steve Champeon and Nick\\nFinck at SXSW in 2003 in a presentation titled “Inclusive Web Design for the\\nFuture”, this strategy emphasizes access to the basic content and functionality for\\nall users, regardless of browser feature support, device features and capabilities,\\nor internet connection speed. Additional style and interaction layers are progres-\\nsively added as feature support and capabilities are detected, ensuring that people\\nwith newer browsers, more advanced devices, or faster connections receive a\\nmore enhanced experience without obscuring the core content. It’s an approach\\nthat stands in contrast to a previous strategy known as “graceful degradation,”\\nwhich places emphasis on fault tolerance and focuses first on the more advanced\\nsoftware and hardware while providing a fallback for others.\\nProgressive enhancement’s strength centers around its ability to liberally\\naccept any range of browser feature support, any level of device capability sup-\\nport, and any connection speed and to conservatively layer enhancements while\\npreserving the core content, thus enabling universal access for everyone. Take,\\nfor example, a simple search box, which provides the ability for anyone to select\\nit and enter a search query but is enhanced to support voice input for devices\\nthat support voice recognition ( Figure 5-3 ). Everyone will get a default search\\nbox initially, and it will be usable by everyone, including those using assistive\\ntechnology such as screen readers. If voice recognition support is detected, a\\nlayer of functional enhancement is added by allowing the user to select the\\n58 | LAWS OF UX\\nmicrophone icon to invoke a voice assistant that will transcribe speech to text,\\nthereby extending the input methods of the search box without taking away from\\nits core functionality.\\nFigure 5-3. A progressively enhanced search component that provides a search box by default,\\nand then voice support for devices that support voice recognition\\nExamples of Postel’s law aren’t limited to interfaces—they can also be found\\nin our processes. Take, for example, design systems, which are collections of\\nreusable components and patterns guided by standards that define how they are\\nused. The goal of a design system is to enable these components and patterns to\\nbe assembled to build any number of applications and to provide a framework for\\nensuring the extensibility of designs. These tools have proven incredibly valuable,\\nenabling companies to scale design in a consistent manner across the organiza-\\ntion ( Figure 5-4 ). To create an effective design system, organizations must be\\nliberal in terms of what is accepted: everything from design, content, and code\\nto strategy, opinions, and criticism may be provided by a diverse team of contrib-\\nutors. In contrast, the output of the design system is conservative: guidelines,\\ncomponents, patterns, and principles must all be clear and purposeful.\\nFigure 5-4. Design systems have enabled design to scale in a manageable and consistent\\nmanner within a number of well-known companies—pictured here, from left to right, are\\nCarbon Design System by IBM, Lightning Design System by Salesforce, and Polaris by Shopify\\n(source: IBM, Salesforce, Shopify, 2023)\\nPOSTEL’S LAW | 59\\nTECHNIQUE\\nUser Interviews\\nPostel’s law is about bridging the communication gap between humans\\nand computers by making technology more human. Designing good\\nuser experiences means designing good human experiences, and this\\nrequires us to understand our users. We can predict but must not\\nassume things about where they are, how they work, and the technology\\nthey use. One incredibly effective method for uncovering this information\\nabout our users is through user interviews. A user interview is a quick\\nand easy way to collect user data in a one-on-one session in which a\\nresearcher asks questions about a topic of interest, such as system use,\\nbehaviors, and habits, in order to gain insights about that topic. Such\\ninterviews can provide insights into what users think about a site, appli-\\ncation, product, or process, including what content is memorable, what\\nis important, and ideas for improvement. Interviews can be conducted\\nbefore design, to enrich a contextual inquiry study, or at the end of a\\nusability test to collect verbal responses related to observed behaviors.\\nDefine the goal of the interview\\nWhat exactly are you or your stakeholders hoping to learn? Or what\\nare you trying to understand better? Ensure you collect valuable\\ninformation for your design by making the goal concise and related\\nto a specific aspect of the users’ behavior or attitudes. For example,\\nlearn more about our users is too broad and ambiguous of a goal\\nbecause it lacks the focus that will be valuable to improve specific\\naspects of the design. On the other hand, a goal such as learn how\\ndoctors share patient medical history with fellow doctors, and where\\nthey feel there are challenges and opportunities is more effective\\nand likely to lead to more actionable insights.\\nPrepare your discussion guide\\nBe sure to prepare questions beforehand that focus around the\\ngoal of the interview. Don’t be afraid to ask relevant follow-up ques-\\ntions based on the participant’s responses. A natural, free-flowing\\nconversation can lead to unexpected, fruitful insights. A general\\nguide of themes to discuss can sometimes be more useful than a\\nlist of rigid questions.\\n60 | LAWS OF UX\\nBuild rapport with the interviewee\\nAn important yet sometimes overlooked step in conducting a user\\ninterview is making the interviewee feel comfortable. T o build rap-\\nport with the interviewee, start by asking them about themselves,\\nwhere they live, and if they’ve done anything like this before.\\nReassure them that there are no right or wrong answers, address\\nquestions they may have, and be sure to let them know that the\\ninterview is in no way a test of their knowledge or abilities. People\\nare more likely to open up and provide valuable information once\\nthey are relaxed and trust the interviewer.\\nAvoid leading questions\\nDon’t ask closed questions that are answerable with a “yes” or\\n“no, ” or questions that are too vague to get specific and valua-\\nble responses. The goals is to elicit rich, unbiased answers from\\nthe interviewee. Open questions start with “what, ” “how, ” “when”—\\nor “tell me about X. ” Additionally, be mindful of how you frame\\nquestions—how we ask a question can sometimes influence the\\nresponse, which we want to avoid in order to get the most accurate\\ndata.\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nDesign Resiliency\\nThe input that users provide to a system is variable and may span a\\nwide spectrum. Therefore, to ensure a better user experience, we should\\ndesign systems that are liberal in their acceptance of input. However, this\\nalso means there is an increased opportunity for things to go wrong, or\\nto at least result in a less than ideal user experience. The more we can\\nanticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.\\nT ake, for example, the topic of internationalization. The same text\\nstring can span different lengths, depending on the language. Many\\ndesigners plan only for their native language, while not accounting for\\ntext expansion in other languages that could result in a considerable\\nincrease in length. English, a very compact language, contains words that\\ncan expand up to 300% when translated into a less compact language\\nPOSTEL’S LAW | 61\\nsuch as Italian (Figure 5-5). T ext orientation can also vary per region of\\nthe world—from left-to-right in many Western countries to right-to-left or\\neven vertical in others. By designing with these variations in mind, we can\\ncreate more robust designs that can adapt to varying text string lengths\\nand text orientations.\\nFigure 5-5. Text expansion from English (left) to Italian (right) (source: w3.org)\\nAnother example is the default font size, which the user can custom-\\nize both on mobile devices and in browsers. The purpose of this feature\\nis to give the user control over the display, typically by increasing the\\nsize of all text throughout an application or website and thereby improv-\\ning its accessibility. However, this can cause problems in designs that\\ndon’t account for the possibility of the text size increasing—specifically,\\nhow it affects layout and the space available for text. Adaptable designs\\naccount for this feature and have a graceful response. T ake, for example,\\nAmazon, which does a great job of responding to font size customization\\nin its website header navigation (Figure 5-6). The design accounts for the\\npossibility of minimum font size customization by organizing the quick\\nlinks below the search bar by importance and removing the links of lesser\\nimportance as the font size increases.\\nFigure 5-6. Amazon.com adapting to minimum font size customization\\n(source: Amazon, 2023)\\n62 | LAWS OF UX\\nConclusion\\nPostel’s law can help us bridge the gap between human and machine. By design-\\ning systems that liberally accept variable human input and translate it into a\\nstructured, machine-friendly output, we transfer this burden away from users\\nand therefore ensure a more human user experience. This allows us to build\\nproducts and services that are robust and adaptable to fit the needs of growing\\nscale and complexity. While it also means there is an increased opportunity for\\nthings to go wrong, we can anticipate and plan for this in design and thus ensure\\nour work is more resilient.\\nPOSTEL’S LAW | 63\\n\\nPeak–End Rule\\nPeople judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and\\nat its end, rather than on the total sum or average of every moment of the\\nexperience.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final•\\nmoments (the “end”) of the user journey.\\n• Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable,•\\nor entertaining and design to delight the end user.\\n• Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly•\\nthan positive ones.\\nOverview\\nAn interesting thing happens when we recollect a past event. Instead of consid-\\nering the entire duration of the experience, we tend to focus on an emotional\\npeak and on the end, regardless of whether those moments were positive or\\nnegative. In other words, we remember each of our life experiences as a series\\nof representative snapshots rather than a comprehensive timeline of events. Our\\nfeelings during the most emotionally intense moments and at the end are aver-\\naged in our minds and heavily influence how we recall the overall experience to\\ndetermine whether we’d be willing to do it again or recommend it to others. This\\nobservation, known as the peak–end rule, strongly suggests we should pay close\\n65\\n| 6\\n1 Daniel Kahneman, Barbara L. Fredrickson, Charles A. Schreiber, and Donald A.

The first trial involved participants\\nsubmerging a hand in 14°C water (roughly 57°F) for 60 seconds. The second trial\\ninvolved participants submerging the other hand in 14°C water for 60 seconds\\nand then keeping it submerged for an additional 30 seconds as the water was\\nwarmed to 15°C. When given the choice of which experience they would repeat,\\nparticipants were more willing to repeat the second trial, despite it being a\\nlonger exposure to the uncomfortable water temperatures. The conclusion by\\nthe authors was that the participants chose the longer trial simply because they\\npreferred the memory of it in comparison to the first trial.\\nSubsequent studies would corroborate this conclusion, beginning with a\\n1996 study by Kahneman and Redelmeier 2 that found that colonoscopy or litho-\\ntripsy patients consistently evaluated the discomfort of their experience based\\non the intensity of pain at the worst and final moments, regardless of length\\nor variation in intensity of pain within the procedure. A later study by some of\\nthe same researchers 3 expanded on this by randomly dividing patients into two\\ngroups: one that underwent a typical colonoscopy, and another that underwent\\nthe same procedure in addition to having the tip of the scope left in for three\\nextra minutes without inflation or suction. When asked afterward which they\\npreferred, patients who underwent the longer procedure experienced the final\\nmoments as less painful, rated their overall experience as less unpleasant, and\\nranked the procedure as less aversive in comparison to the other participants.\\nAdditionally, those that underwent the longer procedure were more likely to\\nreturn for subsequent procedures—a result of these participants judging the\\nexperience positively because of the less painful end.\\n66 | LAWS OF UX\\n4 Daniel Kahneman and Amos T versky, “Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness, ” Cognitive\\nPsychology 3, no. 3 (1972): 430–54.\\n5 Scott Plous, The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making (New Y ork: McGraw-Hill, 1993).\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT\\nCognitive Biases\\nT o understand the peak–end rule, it is helpful to have an understanding\\nof cognitive biases.  The topic warrants an entire book of its own, but here\\nI’ll just give a brief introduction in the context of the peak–end rule.\\nCognitive biases are systematic errors of thinking or rationality in\\njudgment that influence our perception of the world and our decision-\\nmaking ability. First introduced by Amos T versky and Daniel Kahneman\\nin 1972,4 these mental shortcuts increase our efficiency by enabling us\\nto make quick decisions without the need to thoroughly analyze a situa-\\ntion. Instead of constantly becoming paralyzed by the process of mental\\nexamination every time we must make a decision, we can rely on these\\nunconscious automatic responses to help expedite things, engaging in\\nheavier mental processing only when necessary. However, cognitive bia-\\nses can also distort our thinking and perception, ultimately leading to\\ninaccurate judgment and poor decisions.\\nPerhaps you’ve tried to have a logical discussion about a polarizing\\nhot-button issue with someone else, only to discover it was incredibly\\ndifficult. The underlying reason for this can quite often be attributed\\nto the fact that we attempt to preserve our existing beliefs by paying\\nattention to information that confirms those beliefs and discounting\\ninformation that challenges them.  This is known as confirmation bias:\\na bias of belief in which people tend to seek out, interpret, and recall\\ninformation in a way that confirms their preconceived notions and ideas.5\\nThis is but one of many common biases humans are susceptible to on a\\ndaily basis.\\nThe peak–end rule, also a cognitive bias, is known as a memory\\nbias because it impairs the recall of a memory. We remember intensely\\nemotional events more than less emotional events, and this has an effect\\non how we perceive an experience: we recall not the sum of how we felt\\nthroughout the experience but the average of how we felt during its peak\\nemotional moments and at its end.\\nPEAK–END RULE | 67\\nThe peak–end rule is related to another cognitive bias known as the\\nrecency effect, which states that items near the end of a sequence are\\nthe easiest to recall.\\nExamples\\nLet’s take a look at a few examples, beginning with a company that understands\\nthe power of personalization to create a memorable user experience. The end\\nof the year is a good time to reflect back on the memories, challenges, and\\naccomplishments of the prior 365 days. It’s in many ways an end to one version\\nof ourselves and the beginning of a new version. Spotify recognizes this reflective\\nmoment and uses it to offer its users the opportunity to look back on their\\nlast 365 days of music and audio listening with Spotify Wrapped. The feature\\nshows stats like the user’s most liked artists, songs played the most, listening\\nstatistics, and interesting features such as an “audio aura” that changes colors, a\\nquiz you can interact with, soundtracks for movies personalized to you, rankings\\nof listeners around the world, and more ( Figure 6-1). Spotify utilizes the power\\nof personalization to make experiences feel special and connected to the user\\nby enabling them to introspect upon what they know about themselves through\\nmusic, learn more about the artists and podcasts they’ve enjoyed, and subscribe\\nto a larger musical community through sharing. It’s a moment throughout\\nthe Spotify user experience journey that is bound to create a lasting positive\\nimpression.\\nFigure 6-1. Spotify Wrapped 2022 (source: Spotify, 2022)\\n68 | LAWS OF UX\\n6 Candice Hogan, “How Uber Leverages Applied Behavioral Science at Scale, ” Uber Engineering (blog),\\nJanuary 28, 2019, https:/ /oreil.ly/n1csD.\\nPositive events aren’t the only ones that have an impact on how people feel\\nabout a product or service. Negative events also provide emotional peaks and can\\ncontribute to a user’s lasting impression of an experience. Take, for example,\\nwait times, which can have a profound effect on how people perceive a product\\nor service. Ride-sharing company Uber realized that waiting was an unavoidable\\npart of its Express POOL business model and sought to reduce this pain point\\nby focusing on three concepts related to wait time: idleness aversion, operational\\ntransparency, and the goal gradient effect, concepts that have since made their\\nway into all Uber services ( Figure 6-2 ).6 Uber customers are presented with\\nan animation that helps to keep them not only informed but also entertained\\n(idleness aversion). The app provides an estimated time of arrival and informa-\\ntion on how arrival times are calculated (operational transparency). It clearly\\nexplains each step of the process so customers feel that they are continuously\\nmaking progress toward their goal of getting a ride (goal gradient effect). By\\nfocusing on people’s perceptions of time and waiting, Uber was able to reduce\\nits post-request cancellation rate and avoid what could easily become a negative\\nemotional peak while using its service.\\nFigure 6-2. Uber app (source: Uber, 2023)\\nAnother company that demonstrates proficiency in understanding how peak\\nmoments impact user experience is Duolingo. Its platform provides a fun and\\neffective way to learn a language that is enjoyable and easy to use, while also\\nencouraging users to continue learning. One important way it makes the process\\nof learning a new language engaging is through gamified features such as levels\\nPEAK–END RULE | 69\\nand streaks, which celebrate learning milestones ( Figure 6-3). These celebratory\\nmoments represent the accumulation of all the work that goes into learning\\na new language. Duolingo understands the importance of these moments and\\ngoes beyond presenting a simple progress indicator. By infusing a touch of\\nbrand character through illustration, subtle animation, and humor, the platform\\nreinforces achievement and makes the experience more engaging.\\nFigure 6-3. Duolingo gamified features (source: Duolingo, 2023)\\nDuolingo’s artful capitalization on key moments doesn’t end there. With\\nLegendary Level challenges, users strive to complete timed challenges that make\\ndaily language learning more interesting. If a Legendary Level is successfully\\ncompleted, the user is rewarded a new theme in the interface ( Figure 6-4). These\\ndetails reinforce the feeling of accomplishment and enhance the experience,\\ncreating positive mental snapshots for people that use this service.\\n70 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 6-4. Legendary Level unlock screen (source: Duolingo, 2023)\\nTECHNIQUE\\nJourney Mapping\\nOne handy tool for identifying the emotional peaks of end users through-\\nout an experience is journey mapping. This qualitative exercise is invalu-\\nable for visualizing how people use a product or service through the\\nnarrative of accomplishing a specific task or goal. Journey mapping\\nresults in the creation of a design artifact (Figure 6-5) that not only helps\\ndesigners and project stakeholders align to a common mental model but\\nalso creates a deeper shared understanding of the customer experience\\nand aids in identifying the challenges and opportunities present within an\\nexperience.\\nPEAK–END RULE | 71\\nFigure 6-5. Example journey map\\nLike all design exercises, journey maps can and should be tailored to\\nthe purposes and goals of the project and be grounded in research that’s\\nbeen conducted with real users. That being said, they’ll usually contain\\nsome key information:\\nLens\\nThe lens of a journey map establishes the perspective of the per-\\nson the experience represents. It usually will contain the persona\\nof the end user, which should be predefined based on research\\non the target audience of the product or service (see Chapter 1,\\n“ Jakob’s Law”). The lens should capture the specific scenario that\\nthe journey map is focused on. This scenario may be real, or it can\\nbe anticipated in the case of a product or service that hasn’t been\\nlaunched yet. Finally, the lens usually describes the expectations of\\nthe persona in that scenario. For example, Jane (persona) is using a\\nride-share service app to order a ride (scenario) that she expects to\\narrive at her exact location in 10 minutes or less (expectation).\\n72 | LAWS OF UX\\nExperience\\nThe next part of a journey map is the experience section, which\\nillustrates the actions, mindset, and emotions of the end user\\nmapped across a timeline. Starting from the top, the experience\\nis first organized into high-level phases. Next are the actions, which\\ndefine the steps that the end user must take within each phase to\\naccomplish their task or goal. Following the actions is information\\npertaining to the mindset of the end user during the experience.\\nThis can vary based on what insights the journey map is aiming to\\nuncover; it’s essentially a contextual layer of information that pro-\\nvides a deeper view into what the customer is thinking during each\\nphase. T ypical information captured within this layer includes gen-\\neral thoughts, pain points, questions, or motivations that originate\\nfrom research and user interviews. Finally, there’s the emotional\\nlayer, which is usually represented as a continuous line mapped\\nacross the entire experience and which captures the emotional\\nstate of the persona during the experience. This layer is especially\\nsignificant with regard to the peak–end rule, because it captures\\nthe emotional peaks of the customer.\\nInsights\\nThe last part of a journey map is the insights section, which identi-\\nfies the important takeaways that surface within the experience.\\nThis section usually contains a list of possible opportunities to\\nimprove the overall experience. It also typically contains a list of\\nmetrics associated with improving the experience, and details on\\nthe internal ownership of these metrics. Going back to our ride-\\nshare example, providing real-time information on the location of\\nthe vehicle after the ride is ordered can help reduce the pain point\\nof waiting (opportunity). That feature will need to be designed and\\ndeveloped by the product team (internal ownership) and can be\\nmonitored according to post-ride ratings (metric).\\nPEAK–END RULE | 73\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nNegativity Bias\\nWe have a tendency as humans not only to register negative events more\\nreadily but also to dwell on these events. This bias toward the negative\\nleads you to pay much more attention to the bad things that happen,\\nmaking them seem much more important than they really are. It is inevi-\\ntable that at some point in the lifespan of a product or service something\\nwill go wrong. There might be a server failure that has a ripple effect and\\nleads to service outages, a bug that opens up a security vulnerability, or\\na design decision that fails to consider all customers and leads to some\\nunintended consequences. All of these types of situations can have an\\nemotional effect on the people that use your product and may ultimately\\ninform their overall impression of the experience.\\nWe must mitigate negative peaks whenever possible and thus avoid\\nthe negativity bias associated with them. An incredibly effective way to\\ndo this is to provide guidance during the user journey that prevents\\nusers from ending up facing an error or confusing state to begin with.\\nOne place in particular that can lead to a negative experience is account\\ncreation, specifically the requirements for passwords to ensure they are\\nsecure. Rigid password rules can quickly lead to frustration just as peo-\\nple are excited enough about a product or service to create an account\\nand give it a try. Mailchimp avoids this potential pain point by providing\\nreal-time validation to ensure passwords are secure while also making\\nthe rules easy to follow (Figure 6-6).\\nFigure 6-6. Real-time password validation (source: Mailchimp, 2023)\\n74 | LAWS OF UX\\nSetbacks can also be opportunities, however, if the right fallbacks\\nare in place. T ake, for example, the all-too-common 404 error page.\\nWhen a web page can’t be found, users may become frustrated, creating\\na negative impression. But some companies use this as an opportunity\\nto create a rapport with their customers and enforce their brand per-\\nsonality by leveraging some good old-fashioned humor (Figure 6-7). It’s\\nimportant to note that humor can only go so far—the last thing you want\\nto do is make a negative experience even worse. We must be mindful of\\ncontext and the appropriateness of how we communicate with our users\\nto choose the right approach.\\nFigure 6-7. Various 404 pages that use humor and brand personality\\n(sources [clockwise from top left]: Dribbble, Spotify, Pixar, and GitHub, 2023)\\nPEAK–END RULE | 75\\nConclusion\\nOur memories are rarely a perfectly accurate record of events. How users recall\\nan experience will determine how likely they are to use a product or service\\nagain or recommend it to others. Since we judge past experiences based not on\\nhow we felt throughout the whole duration of the event but on the average of\\nhow we felt at the peak emotional moments and at the end, it is vital that these\\nmoments make a lasting good impression. By paying close attention to these key\\nmoments of an experience, we can ensure users recollect the experience as a\\nwhole positively.\\n76 | LAWS OF UX\\n\\n\\nAesthetic–Usability\\nEffect\\nUsers often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more\\nusable.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• Aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in•\\npeople’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually\\nworks better.\\n• People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design•\\nof a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.\\n• Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent•\\nissues from being discovered during usability testing.\\nOverview\\nAs designers, we understand that our work is about more than just how some-\\nthing looks; it’s also about how it works. That’s not to say good design can’t also\\nbe attractive design. In fact, an aesthetically pleasing design can influence usabil-\\nity. Not only does it create a positive emotional response, but it also enhances our\\ncognitive abilities, increases the perception of usability, and extends credibility.\\nIn other words, an aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in\\n79\\n| 7\\n1 F .

First impres-\\nsions do matter.\\nIn this chapter, we’ll explore the origins of this principle, learn more about\\nhow our brains interpret information based on aesthetic attractiveness, and take\\na look at a few examples that make use of this effect.\\nOrigins\\nThe origins of the aesthetic–usability effect can be traced back to a study con-\\nducted in 1995 by researchers Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura from the\\nHitachi Design Center. 2 Prior to this, the relationship between aesthetics and\\ndigital interfaces had been largely unexplored. The study, which began as an\\nattempt to investigate the relationship between inherent usability and something\\nthe researchers called “apparent usability,” demonstrated the correlation between\\npeople’s perceptions of ease of use and visual attractiveness.\\nKurosu and Kashimura tested 26 layout patterns of ATM interfaces\\n(Figure 7-1) with 252 participants and asked each of them to rate each design\\naccording to both functionality and aesthetics.\\n80 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 7-1. Sample layout patterns (source: Kurosu and Kashimura, 1995)\\nThe participants used a 10-point rating scale to evaluate the usability and\\nvisual attractiveness of each design. The results showed that their perception of\\nusability was strongly influenced by their perception of the attractiveness of the\\ninterface ( Figure 7-2). In other words, apparent usability is less correlated with\\ninherent ease of use than with apparent beauty.\\nAESTHETIC–USABILITY EFFECT | 81\\n3 Noam T ractinsky, Adi S.

Correlation of usability with beauty (source: Kurosu and Kashimura, 1995)\\nSubsequent research, such as the 2000 study “What Is Beautiful Is Usable”\\nby Noam Tractinsky et al., corroborates Kurosu and Kashimura’s findings and\\nfurther confirms that the aesthetics of the interface of a system affect users’\\nperceptions of the usability of the system. 3 The correlations between perceived\\nattractiveness and other qualities (including trust and credibility) have also been\\nexplored, as have the effects of aesthetics on usability testing (see the Key Consid-\\neration “Effect on Usability Tests” later in this chapter).\\n82 | LAWS OF UX\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT\\nAutomatic Cognitive Processing\\nContrary to what we’ve been taught not to do, people do in fact judge\\nbooks by their covers. This isn’t actually a bad thing, though—in fact, it’s\\nnecessary. Automatic cognitive processing is helpful because it enables\\nus to react quickly. Carefully processing every object around us would\\nbe slow, inefficient, and in some circumstances dangerous, so we begin\\nto mentally process information and form an opinion based on past\\nexperiences before directing our conscious attention toward what we’re\\nperceiving. This automatic and involuntary mode of thinking stands in\\ncontrast to the slower and more deliberate mode of thinking that fol-\\nlows, and it’s exactly what psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman\\nexplores in his 2013 book Thinking, Fast and Slow (Farrar, Straus and\\nGiroux). This psychodrama with two characters, System 1 and System 2,\\ndetails the relationship between the two forms of cognitive processing\\nand how they influence our decision making.\\nSystem 1 operates impulsively and involves little or no psychological\\neffort. It is quick, and there is no sense of voluntary control. This mode\\nof thinking is among the innate abilities we share with other animals, and\\nit enables us to recognize objects, identify danger, direct our attention,\\navoid loss, and quickly react based on experience or prolonged practice.\\nSystem 1 is the system that runs automatically and generates informa-\\ntion (intuitions, feelings, intentions, or impressions) for System 2.\\nSystem 2 operates more slowly and requires mental effort. It is the\\nsystem called upon when System 1 runs into difficulty, and it provides\\nsupport in the form of more detailed and specific processing, with the\\ngoal of solving the problem at hand. This is the system of thinking\\nthat we use for complex problem solving that requires attention. Focus,\\nresearch, searching memory, mathematical operations (beyond simple\\narithmetic), and situational awareness are all things that involve this\\nmode of thinking.\\nThe interaction of these two systems centers around minimizing\\neffort and optimizing performance. System 1 handles most of what we\\nthink and do, and System 2 takes over when necessary. The implications\\nof this when it comes to digital products and experiences are monumen-\\ntal. We rely on System 1 to quickly identify information relevant to our\\nAESTHETIC–USABILITY EFFECT | 83\\n4 Gitte Lindgaard, Gary Fernandes, Cathy Dudek, and Judith M.

We rapidly scan the available information in search of what will\\nhelp us achieve our goal, and anything that isn’t a match is passed over.\\nWhen it comes to the aesthetic–usability effect, System 1 thinking is\\nincredibly important because this is where we form first impressions. In\\nfact, studies have shown that people form an opinion about a website\\nwithin 50 milliseconds of seeing it, and that visual appeal is a primary\\ndetermining factor.4 Interestingly, the opinion formed during this brief\\nperiod—the visceral response—rarely changes as users spend more time\\non the site. While our first impressions are not always foolproof, they\\nusually are relatively accurate and help us to make quick decisions.\\nExamples\\nWe’ll start our examples of the aesthetic–usability effect by looking closely at two\\ncompanies that have put aesthetics at the center of what they do. First is Braun,\\nthe German electronics company, which has made an indelible mark in the\\nworld of design and exemplifies how aesthetically pleasing products can create\\na lasting impression. Under the design direction of Dieter Rams, and guided\\nby the Bauhaus philosophy of form follows function , the company has influenced\\ngenerations of designers with its products’ balance of functional minimalism and\\naesthetic beauty. Rams’s “less but better” approach, which emphasizes form fol-\\nlowing function, has directly resulted in some of the most well-designed products\\never produced.\\n84 | LAWS OF UX\\nTake, for example, the Braun SK4 record player ( Figure 7-3 ), nicknamed\\n“Snow White’s Coffin” due to its white metal casing and transparent lid. Con-\\nstructed of powder-coated sheet metal with elmwood side panels, it stood in dras-\\ntic contrast to the lavishly ornamented all-wood products more typically available\\nto consumers at the time of its production in 1956. The SK4 was one of Braun’s\\nfirst products to pioneer the company’s new contemporary industrial design\\nlanguage in which every detail had a functional purpose, including the plexiglass\\ncover that resolved the rattling at higher volumes observed with metal covers.\\nProducts like this one mark a pivotal point in design history, when electronic\\ndevices went from being disguised as furniture to being presented as standalone\\nentities that were beautiful and functional.\\nFigure 7-3. Braun SK4 record player, designed by Hans Gugelot and Dieter Rams\\n(source: Museum of Modern Art)\\nAESTHETIC–USABILITY EFFECT | 85\\nNow let’s take a look at an example of a brand that in many ways continues\\nBraun’s legacy of functional minimalism balanced by refined aesthetics: Apple.\\nThe influence of Braun’s design philosophy on Apple’s products is quite appa-\\nrent. Devices such as the iPod, iPhone, and iMac echo the beautifully minimal\\naesthetic of Braun’s product lines while focusing on ease of use (Figure 7-4).\\nFigure 7-4. Apple iPod (top left), Apple iPhone (top middle), Apple iMac (top\\nright), Braun T3 pocket radio (bottom left), Braun ET44 calculator (bottom middle),\\nand Braun LE1 loudspeaker (bottom right)\\nApple’s attention to aesthetics extends beyond industrial design—the brand\\nis well known for creating interfaces that are both elegant and easy to use\\n(Figure 7-5). In fact, its reputation in this regard has become a competitive advan-\\ntage and helped to usher in a new era in which good design is fundamental to\\nsuccessful businesses. The attention to detail in everything the company creates\\nhas directly contributed to Apple becoming one of the most beloved brands in\\nthe world. That’s not to say that its products’ interfaces don’t have any usability\\nissues, but people are much more likely to overlook these issues due to the\\npleasing aesthetic that’s at the core of the design—the aesthetic–usability effect at\\nwork.\\n86 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 7-5. Screenshot of various Apple interface designs (source: Apple, 2023)\\nTECHNIQUE\\nUsability T esting\\nA simple truth that designers (or anyone else working within a design\\nteam) must embrace in order to create more effective products and\\nexperiences is the fact that we are not the user. We’re much too close to\\nwhat we build to objectively see it and understand how users will interact\\nwith it. The best user interfaces are those that have been shaped by\\nobservations of real users and their interactions with them. So how can\\ndesigners shape their work to be more effective? An incredibly effective\\nway is with usability testing. The goal of this observational method is\\nto uncover problems in a design, discover existing opportunities, and\\nlearn more about the behaviors and preferences of users by asking par-\\nticipants to engage in realistic activities. It is one of the most effective\\ntechniques for understanding how well a design will perform once it is\\nin the hands of real users. Designers can use this method to improve\\ntheir work through subsequent iterations based on the findings from\\nrepresentative users.\\nPlanning the test\\nThe first thing to do when conducting a usability test is to plan\\nit. This includes defining the objectives, writing a test script, and\\nfinding people to take part. Begin by establishing the goals of your\\ntest and what you are trying to learn. Is the goal to ensure how\\nAESTHETIC–USABILITY EFFECT | 87\\n5 Mayya Azarova, “The Hawthorne Effect or Observer Bias in User Research, ” Nielsen Norman Group, May 21,\\n2023, https:/ /oreil.ly/-UY6W.\\nwell users understand a specific feature or workflow? Document\\nyour objectives and anything else that will help frame the outcome\\nof the test. Next, write a test script based around tasks that you’d\\nlike to see users perform. Y ou can think of these as prompts that\\ninitiate your test participants to perform specific tasks that you can\\nobserve and learn from. Finally, target and recruit representative\\nusers of the product or service you’re building. Don’t rely solely on\\nusability data from your own team or company unless what you’re\\ndesigning is intended exclusively for them.\\nConducting the test\\nAsk participants to perform realistic tasks using a prototype or\\nan actual product. The tasks can be very specific or open-ended,\\ndepending on the goals of the test. It’s important to remain neutral,\\nhelp participants understand that they are helping you test the\\ndesign and that you are not testing them, and avoid priming partici-\\npants with specific text found in the design.\\nWhile you are running the test, make sure to listen intently and\\navoid biasing the participants. It’s also common to ask participants\\nto think out loud, which helps you to better understand their behav-\\niors, goals, thoughts, and motivations. Be sure to measure both the\\nspeed and ease with which participants perform tasks in addition\\nto what they say about it—how well participants perform doesn’t\\nalways match their subjective rating of a task.\\nFinally, it is important to remember that the mere act of being\\nobserved can potentially influence participants to behave in ways\\nthat they believe are expected of them, a phenomenon known as\\nobserver bias.5 We can mitigate its effects by emphasizing that the\\nstudy is meant to test the design and not their abilities or knowl-\\nedge, and that their honest feedback will be used to improve the\\ndesign and will not be shared outside of the study.\\nSynthesizing the data\\nOnce you’ve conducted the test and captured data, it’s time to\\nsynthesize it into insights that can be turned into actionable next\\n88 | LAWS OF UX\\nsteps. Synthesis is best done as a group activity: include everyone\\nwho participated directly in the interview process. It’s even better if\\nyou can involve the entire core project team; doing so will increase\\nthe team’s understanding, investment, and empathy toward users\\nfrom the beginning. Involving more people in the synthesis also\\nhelps to ensure more perspectives when interpreting the data and\\ncan be critical in avoiding the biases that come with a singular point\\nof view.\\nNext, establish a structure for your synthesis, beginning with\\na summary of the goals and how the study was conducted. Make\\nsure to document team members that helped during the study\\nalong with their roles, the details of those who participated, and\\nhow the data was gathered. Pull out quotes and observations cap-\\ntured during the study that indicate the participants’ goals, priori-\\nties, actions, motivations, pain points, habits, interactions, tools,\\nor context (environment or other influencing factors). Quotes and\\nobservations should then be grouped by themes or patterns, which\\nwill in turn inform insights and their implications for the design.\\nMake sure to look back at the problem you started with and see\\nif the patterns you saw while doing the test help answer the ques-\\ntions you asked. It’s important to remember to avoid solutions dur-\\ning this step—the focus is on the insights you can surface in order\\nto understand the context and needs of the user. Additionally, avoid\\nidentifying larger patterns before having gone through all the data\\nand differentiating observations from their potential meaning.\\nThe last step is to document the synthesis in a shareable for-\\nmat. Succinctness is the most effective quality to strive for, but\\nbe sure to include the research goals, methods, insights, and rec-\\nommendations. Reinforce insights with specific examples from the\\nresearch. Remember that research oftentimes will indicate what\\nyou should learn more about. This is a totally valid outcome, and\\nyou can use those insights as the starting point for additional\\nresearch.\\nAESTHETIC–USABILITY EFFECT | 89\\n6 Andreas Sonderegger and Jürgen Sauer, “The Influence of Design Aesthetics in Usability T esting: Effects on\\nUser Performance and Perceived Usability, ” Applied Ergonomics 41, no. 3 (2010): 403–10.\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nEffect on Usability T ests\\nThe positive benefits of aesthetically pleasing design come with a signifi-\\ncant caveat. Since people tend to believe that beautiful experiences also\\nwork better, they can be more forgiving when it comes to usability issues.\\nPsychologists Andreas Sonderegger and Jürgen Sauer observed exactly\\nhow aesthetics affect usability tests.6 Using a computer simulation of\\na mobile phone, 60 adolescents were asked to complete a number of\\ncommon tasks. T wo separate simulations were used that were function-\\nally identical but differentiated by their visual attractiveness—one was\\nvisually appealing (for the time), and the other was notably unattractive\\n(Figure 7-6).\\nFigure 7-6. The two prototypes employed in the experiment\\n(source: Sonderegger and Sauer, 2010)\\nSonderegger and Sauer found that not only did participants rate\\nusability higher for the more attractive phone (the model on the left),\\nbut the visual appearance of the phone “had a positive effect on per-\\nformance, leading to reduced task completion times for the attractive\\nmodel. ” What this study implies is that perceived aesthetic quality\\nhas the potential to mask usability issues to an extent. This effect\\napplies even when the device isn’t actually easier to use, and it could\\n90 | LAWS OF UX\\nbe problematic when it comes to usability tests, where identifying issues\\nis critical.\\nKeeping in mind the potential of aesthetics to influence perceived\\nusability, it is important that we mitigate this influence by listening to\\nwhat users say when evaluating the usability of an experience and, more\\nimportantly, watching what they do. Asking questions that lead partici-\\npants to look beyond aesthetics can help to uncover usability issues and\\ncounter the effects that visual attractiveness can have on usability test\\nresults.\\nConclusion\\nAesthetically pleasing design can influence usability by creating a positive emo-\\ntional response, which in turn enhances people’s cognitive abilities. When this\\nhappens, users tend to believe the design actually works better and are more\\nlikely to overlook minor usability issues. While this might seem like a good\\nthing, it can actually mask usability problems and prevent issues from being\\ndiscovered during usability testing.\\nAESTHETIC–USABILITY EFFECT | 91\\n\\n1 Mark P .

Our focus is not only dictated by the goals we seek to accomplish but\\nalso directed by these instinctual abilities.\\nThey also affect how we encode information in memory, and therefore our\\nability to recall items and events at a later point—recognition is prioritized over\\nrecall. When it comes to digital interfaces, an interesting consideration is the ten-\\ndency of contrasting elements to draw our attention faster. A primary challenge\\nwe have as designers is managing what users will focus on in an interface, while\\nsupporting them in achieving their goals. On the one hand, visual emphasis can\\nbe used to guide users toward a goal by capturing their attention. On the other\\nhand, too many points of visual emphasis will compete with one another and\\nmake it harder for people to find the information they need. Color, shape, size,\\nposition, and motion are all factors that come into play in directing the attention\\nof users, and we must carefully consider each of these when building interfaces.\\nOrigins\\nThe von Restorff effect is named after German psychiatrist and pediatrician\\nHedwig von Restorff, who found in a 1933 study employing the isolation para-\\ndigm that participants presented with a list of categorically similar items best\\nremembered ones that were distinctly different.2 In other words, memory is\\nimproved for items of a set that are visually or conceptually isolated from the\\nother items. While von Restorff wasn’t the first to investigate the effects of this\\nparadigm on memory, it became closely associated with her and the study of\\ndistinctiveness. Her initial findings would later be corroborated by research, such\\nas that by Shelley Taylor and Susan Fiske (1978), suggesting that people are\\ndrawn to salient, novel, surprising, or distinctive stimuli.3\\n94 | LAWS OF UX\\n4 Jakob Nielsen, “T unnel Vision and Selective Attention, ” Nielsen Norman Group, August 26, 2012,\\nhttps:/ /oreil.ly/8OHG-.\\n5 Klaus Oberauer, “Working Memory and Attention—A Conceptual Analysis and Review, ” Journal of Cognition\\n2, no. 1 (2019): 36.\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT\\nSelective Attention\\nSimply put, humans live in a world of distraction. Every day, at any given\\nmoment, we are subjected to a plethora of sensory information. While\\ndriving, at work, when attending a social event or simply shopping online,\\nmost people have a multitude of signals competing for their attention.\\nObjects within our field of view might be visible, but we don’t always\\nsee them. The reason for this is because attention plays a fundamental\\nrole in how we perceive the world around us. In order to maintain focus\\non information that is important or relevant to the task at hand, we often\\nfilter out information that isn’t relevant. In other words, our ability to\\nfocus on the things around us is limited in terms of capacity and dura-\\ntion, so we focus on relevant information to the detriment of nonrelevant\\ninformation. It’s a survival instinct known in cognitive psychology as\\nselective attention,4 and it’s critical not only to how we humans perceive\\nthe world around us but also to how we process sensory information in\\ncritical moments that could mean the difference between life and death.\\nAs we saw in Chapter 3’s discussion of Miller’s law and the capacity\\nof short-term memory, attention is also a limited resource. Though there\\nare different ways of conceptualizing memory and attention, there is\\nbroad agreement in the psychological community that working memory\\nis closely related to attention.5 The implications of this with regard to\\ndigital products and services is significant, since the interfaces people\\ninteract with must guide their attention, prevent them from being over-\\nwhelmed or distracted, and help them in finding the relevant information\\nor action.\\nVON RESTORFF EFFECT | 95\\n6 Kara Pernice, “Banner Blindness Revisited: Users Dodge Ads on Mobile and Desktop, ” Nielsen Norman\\nGroup, April 22, 2018, https:/ /oreil.ly/d1wT o.\\n7 Raluca Budiu, “Change Blindness in UX: Definition, ” Nielsen Norman Group, September 23, 2018, https:/ /\\noreil.ly/UAtMz.\\nOne example of selective attention that is common in digital inter-\\nfaces is the user behavior known as banner blindness. Banner blindness\\ndescribes the tendency for people to ignore elements that they perceive\\nto be advertisements, and it is a strong and robust phenomenon that’s\\nbeen documented across three decades.6 When you consider banner\\nblindness in the context of our limited capacity for attention, it makes\\nsense that we’d ignore anything that we don’t typically find helpful (e.g.,\\ndigital ads). Instead, people are more likely to search for items that help\\nthem achieve their goals—especially design patterns such as navigation,\\nsearch bars, headlines, links, and buttons (as Jakob’s law dictates, they\\nwill also instinctively look for these items in common locations). Even\\nlegitimate content elements may be ignored if they remotely resemble\\nads or are placed in close proximity to them. Therefore, it’s good to be\\naware that, when visually differentiating content, we might inadvertently\\nlead to it being mistaken for an ad.\\nRelated to banner blindness is change blindness, which describes\\nthe tendency for people to fail to notice significant changes when they\\nlack strong enough visual cues, or when their attention is focused\\nelsewhere.7 Since our attention is a limited resource, we often ignore\\ninformation we deem irrelevant in order to complete tasks efficiently.\\nBecause our attention is focused on what appears to be most salient,\\nwe may overlook even major differences introduced elsewhere. If it’s\\nimportant that the user be aware of certain changes to the interface of a\\nproduct or service, we should take care to ensure that their attention is\\ndrawn to the elements in question.\\n96 | LAWS OF UX\\nExamples\\nAs you can imagine, examples of the von Restorff effect can be found in every\\ndigital product and service, some of which make use of it more effectively than\\nothers. The need to make specific elements or content visually distinct is funda-\\nmental in design. When this technique is used sparingly and strategically, the\\ncontrast that it affords not only helps draw attention but also directs people to the\\nmost valuable information.\\nA common example of this visual phenomenon can be found in the design\\nof interactive elements such as buttons, text links, and the like. The visual differ-\\nentiation of these elements can help draw people’s attention and inform them of\\nthe actions available to them, guiding users in completing tasks and preventing\\nthem from taking actions they didn’t intend to. To demonstrate, take a look at\\nthe example in Figure 8-1, which depicts two versions of a confirmation modal:\\none with buttons that are visually indistinct from one another, and another with\\nemphasis placed on the most important button. The lack of visual contrast in\\nthe modal on the left could easily lead to people accidentally selecting the wrong\\naction. By placing a visual emphasis on the destructive action, the version on\\nthe right not only will help guide users who want to delete their accounts to the\\ncorrect option but also will help those who don’t intend to delete their accounts\\navoid accidentally selecting this option. For extra safety, there is also a warning\\nicon included in the header of the modal on the right to help draw attention and\\ncommunicate the importance of the content within the modal.\\nFigure 8-1. Example of how contrast can be used to draw attention to important actions\\nand help users avoid accidentally selecting the wrong option\\nVON RESTORFF EFFECT | 97\\nLet’s take the button example a step further and look at an interface that\\nmoves beyond the simple use of color to create contrast. The floating action but-\\nton (FAB), a design pattern introduced by Google’s Material Design ( Figure 8-2),\\n“performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen.” By providing\\nguidelines around the design of this element, its placement on the screen, and\\nwhat actions it should perform, Google ensures its consistency across various\\nproducts and services. As a result, it has become a familiar pattern that people\\nrecognize and that therefore helps to guide their experience (so this is also an\\nexample of Jakob’s law in action).\\nFigure 8-2. Examples of the floating action button from Material Design\\n(source: Google’s Material Design, 2023)\\nAnother common example of the von Restorff effect can be found in pricing\\ntables. Subscription plans are available for most of the services we use, and often\\ncompanies will emphasize one option over the others. To achieve this emphasis,\\ndesigners frequently differentiate the option they want to call out by adding\\nvisual cues. Take, for example, Notion, which places emphasis on the “Plus”\\noption ( Figure 8-3) through the use of color (the darker color is applied to the\\n“Get started” button), shape (the card appears slightly larger due to the “Most\\npopular” element at the top), and position (placing the card close to the center of\\nthe display).\\n98 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 8-3. An example of the von Restorff effect in a pricing table (source: Notion, 2023)\\nThe von Restorff effect can also be seen in design elements intended to grab\\nour attention. Take notifications, for example ( Figure 8-4), which are meant to\\ninform users when something requires them to take action. These ubiquitous\\nelements can be found in almost every app or service and are designed to grab\\nour attention, for better or worse.\\nFigure 8-4. Employing the von Restorff effect to call attention to notifications (source: iOS, 2023)\\nVON RESTORFF EFFECT | 99\\nWe can extend the thinking behind the von Restorff effect and apply it\\nto design going beyond singular elements as well. Take, for example, news\\nwebsites, which commonly place emphasis on featured content in order to make\\nit stand out against lots of other headlines, images, and ads ( Figure 8-5 ). The\\nconsistent pattern you’ll notice on these websites is the use of scale to create con-\\ntrast between the featured content and adjacent content.  The reader’s attention is\\ndrawn to the information that breaks out of the implied columns of content.\\nAs these examples illustrate, visual contrast can be created in many ways.\\nColor is a common way to differentiate elements, but it is by no means the only\\nway to create contrast. Scale, shape, negative space, and motion are additional\\nproperties that can make specific elements or content stand out in comparison to\\nadjacent information.\\nFigure 8-5. News websites often use scale to emphasize featured headlines (sources [clockwise from\\ntop left]: Bloomberg, ProPublica, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe, 2023)\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nAccessibility\\nThe topic of accessibility warrants an entire book on its own, but I’ll\\nhighlight some key visual aspects when it comes to making information,\\nactivities, and environments usable for as many people as possible. It’s\\ncrucial to have an awareness of which visual properties you are using to\\ncreate contrast and how they affect different people:\\n100 | LAWS OF UX\\n8 “Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3, ” World Wide Web Consortium, September 2023.\\nhttps:/ /oreil.ly/GfD4i.\\nColor Contrast\\nT ake, for example, people with color vision deficiency, who are\\nunable to distinguish certain shades of color (or, in some cases,\\nsee any color). Vision impairments such as cataracts can also\\naffect how people perceive detail and difference, causing them to\\nmiss subtle differentiations between elements. It’s important that\\nwe ensure sufficient color contrast exists between foreground and\\nbackground elements to help those who have trouble seeing spe-\\ncific colors or have an impairment that results in low vision.  Color\\ncontrast is particularly important with text—a higher contrast ratio\\nbetween text and background makes it easier for people with low\\nvision to read while also improving the reading experience for peo-\\nple with normal vision. According to the Web Content Accessibility\\nGuidelines (WCAG), the color contrast ratio between text and its\\nbackground should be at least 4.5:1. For larger text (at least 18 pt)\\nor bold text (at least 14 pt), the ratio is a bit more lenient at 3:1.8\\nVisual Cues\\nRelying solely on color to communicate visual contrast, signify\\ninteractive elements, or indicate visual feedback is problematic\\nfor individuals with color blindness or low vision. It’s important to\\nuse additional visual cues such as strokes, patterns, and shape to\\ndifferentiate elements and make interactive elements easily identi-\\nfiable. T ake, for example, focus indicators, which are usually identi-\\nfiable via the thick-weight line around the in-focus element. These\\nvisual indicators help those who navigate using a keyboard and are\\ncommonly applied to links, form fields, widgets, buttons, and menu\\nitems to ensure a clear indication of focus.\\nModeration\\nFinally, it’s important to consider when and how often contrast\\nshould be created—it should be used with intention and not be\\noverused. The only thing worse than no contrast is way too much of\\nit, which not only can dilute the power of the elements or content\\nthat you intended to stand out but can also visually overwhelm\\nVON RESTORFF EFFECT | 101\\npeople. It’s wise to use restraint when placing emphasis on visual\\nelements to ensure they don’t compete with each other.\\nThe importance of moderation is even clearer when we take\\ninto account factors such as banner blindness and change blind-\\nness. If the visual emphasis on content causes the content to be\\nmistakenly identified as an advertisement, then it’s likely to be\\nignored. Additionally, if too many items are emphasized, people are\\nless likely to notice important information or changes that occur:\\nthey may either be distracted or automatically tune out the “noise. ”\\nContrast is also sometimes provided through the use of\\nmotion, but it’s important to consider how this might affect users\\nwith a vestibular disorder, or with any disease, damage, or injury\\nto the system connected to the inner ear and brain that processes\\nthe sensory information involved with controlling balance and eye\\nmovements. T ake, for example, those with benign paroxysmal posi-\\ntional vertigo (BPPV) or labyrinthitis, in whom motion can trigger\\ndizziness, nausea, headaches, or worse. In addition, motion can\\naffect those with epilepsy and migraine sensitivities. We must care-\\nfully consider when and how we use motion in our designs to\\nensure users with motion sensitivity aren’t negatively affected.\\nTECHNIQUE\\nEye T racking\\nEye tracking is a research technique used in user experience design\\nto measure and analyze where users look and how they interact with\\ndigital interfaces or physical objects. By using specialized hardware and\\nsoftware, eye-tracking studies can provide valuable insights into user\\nbehavior, preferences, and cognitive processes. These insights include\\nwhere users look, how they navigate, what they ignore, and their emo-\\ntional responses. Eye tracking provides objective data that is less prone\\nto biases and errors, captures rich insights about user behavior, helps\\nimprove usability, and is cost-effective due to its compatibility with\\nremote and scalable studies.\\nCommon types of eye-tracking studies include heat map, gaze plot,\\nfixation duration, attentional bias, and comparative studies. The type of\\n102 | LAWS OF UX\\nstudy chosen depends on the research question and goals of the study,\\nas well as the characteristics of the interface or object being studied. The\\nfollowing steps are typically involved in conducting an eye-tracking study:\\n1. Define the research question\\nIdentify the research question or hypothesis that the study aims to\\nanswer.\\n2. Select the participants\\nChoose a sample of participants that is representative of the target\\nuser group.\\n3. Set up the equipment\\nSet up the eye-tracking hardware and software, and calibrate the\\nsystem for each participant.\\n4. Develop the stimuli\\nCreate stimuli, such as digital interfaces, websites, or physical\\nobjects, that participants will interact with during the study.\\n5. Conduct the study\\nParticipants interact with the stimuli while their eye movements are\\nrecorded.\\n6. Analyze the data\\nAnalyze the eye-tracking data to answer the research question or\\nhypothesis.\\n7 . Interpret the results\\nInterpret the results and draw conclusions about user behavior,\\npreferences, and cognitive processes.\\nEye tracking is a powerful tool for understanding user behavior, but it\\nhas limitations, such as limited context, interference, limited sample size,\\nlimited stimuli, cultural differences, and technical limitations. It is recom-\\nmended that eye tracking be used in conjunction with other research\\nmethods to gain a complete understanding of user behavior. Additionally,\\nits limitations and potential sources of bias should be carefully consid-\\nered and minimized.\\nVON RESTORFF EFFECT | 103\\nConclusion\\nThe von Restorff effect is a powerful guideline for how to use contrast to direct\\npeople’s attention to the most relevant content. It can help to inform our design\\ndecisions when we want to place emphasis on critical or important actions or\\ninformation, and help to ensure that users of our products and services can\\nquickly identify what they need to achieve their goals. Contrast can also become\\nproblematic when not used with restraint. When designers differentiate elements\\nvisually, the effect is to draw the user’s attention. If too many elements are\\nvisually competing with each other, their power is diluted and they no longer\\nstand out among the other elements. Additionally, we must be aware of how\\nvisual properties we use to create contrast are perceived by those with vision defi-\\nciencies and how those properties might affect people with motion sensitivities.\\n104 | LAWS OF UX\\n\\n\\nT esler’s Law\\nT esler’s law, also known as the law of conservation of complexity, states\\nthat for any system there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be\\nreduced.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed•\\naway and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the\\nuser.\\n• Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by•\\ndealing with inherent complexity during design and development.\\n• T ake care not to simplify interfaces to the point of abstraction.•\\nOverview\\nWho should bear the burden of complexity within an application or a process—\\nthe user, or the designers and developers? This is a fundamental question when\\nconsidering the design of user interfaces and, more broadly, how humans inter-\\nact with technology. A key objective for designers is to reduce complexity for\\nthe people who use the products and services we help to build, yet there is\\nsome inherent complexity in every process. Inevitably, we reach a point at which\\ncomplexity cannot be reduced any further but can only be transferred from one\\nplace to another. At this point, it finds its way either into the user interface or\\ninto the processes and workflows of designers and developers.\\n107\\n| 9\\n1 Dan Saffer, Designing for Interaction: Creating Smart Applications and Clever Devices (Berkeley, CA:\\nPeachpit Press, 2006), 56.\\nOrigins\\nThe origins of Tesler’s law can be traced back to the mid-1980s, when Larry Tes-\\nler, a computer scientist at Xerox PARC, was helping to develop the language of\\ninteraction design—a set of principles, standards, and best practices for defining\\nthe structure and behavior of interactive systems that was key to the development\\nof the desktop computer and desktop publishing. Tesler realized that interface\\nconsistency would benefit not only users but also developers because standards\\ncould be encapsulated in shared software libraries. It was later in his career,\\nwhile working on the Mac app object-oriented framework at Apple, that Tesler\\ncreated an intermediate “generic application” that enabled developers to build\\ntheir own applications by modifying the generic application in an object-oriented\\nway. Tesler defined the law of conservation of complexity as a way to sell the idea\\nto Apple management and independent software vendors with the express pur-\\npose of establishing standards in mass-market software, but also, more impor-\\ntantly, to reduce complexity for customers. Tesler reasoned that “if a million\\nusers each waste a minute a day dealing with complexity that an engineer could\\nhave eliminated in a week by making the software a little more complex, you are\\npenalizing the user to make the engineer’s job easier.”1\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT\\nComplexity Bias\\nIn Chapter 6 we talked about cognitive bias, which serves as a mental\\nshortcut that increases our efficiency by enabling us to make quick deci-\\nsions without the need to thoroughly analyze a situation. In essence,\\ncognitive bias helps us reserve mental energy so we can use it when\\nit matters most, e.g., for complex problem solving, creative thinking,\\netc. We get an incredible amount of benefit from our cognitive bias, but\\nthere are some downsides as well: it often leads to errors in memory,\\njudgment, and decision making.\\n108 | LAWS OF UX\\n2 Shane Parrish, “Complexity Bias: Why We Prefer Complicated to Simple, ” Farnam Street, January 8, 2018,\\nhttps:/ /oreil.ly/i9di1.\\n3 Hilary H. Farris and Russell Revlin, “Sensible Reasoning in T wo T asks: Rule Discovery and Hypothesis\\nEvaluation, ” Memory & Cognition 17 , no. 2 (1989): 221–32, https:/ /doi.org/10.3758/BF03197071.\\nComplexity bias is our tendency to favor complex and intricate solu-\\ntions over straightforward ones, often because complexity is associated\\nwith intelligence, expertise, or depth of understanding.2 Simply put, we\\noften give undue credit to complex concepts or view something that is\\neasy to understand as complex and difficult when we are confused or\\nhaven’t taken the time to truly understand it. This fallacy was clearly\\ndemonstrated in a 1989 paper by Hilary H. Farris and Russell Revlin that\\nstudied how people make hypotheses.3 In one experiment, participants\\nwere given three numbers and asked to figure out a rule. They could ask\\nif other number sequences followed the same rule, but the real rule was\\nsimple: list three numbers that go up. The participants could have said\\nanything like “1, 2, 3” or “3, 7 , 99” and been correct. Most didn’t guess it\\nwas that simple, opting instead for more complicated rules.\\nOur inherent bias toward complexity can be especially problematic\\nwhen we design because it can lead to more complex solutions. When we\\nopt for more complex solutions, we sidestep the need to understand the\\nunderlying problem. The more complexity and assumptions a solution\\nhas, the greater the chance of failure. When we find ourselves favoring a\\nmore complex solution, it’s a good sign that we don’t have enough infor-\\nmation or that we need to better understand the underlying problem. In\\nthese instances, we can avoid making unfounded assumptions and/or\\noverly complex solutions by spending more time with the problem and\\ndeepening our understanding through observation and experience.\\nExamples\\nOne common way to illustrate Tesler’s law is through the humble email. When\\nyou write an email, there are two required pieces of information: who the\\nmessage is from (you), and to whom it should be sent. The email cannot be\\nsent if either of these is missing, and therefore it’s a necessary complexity. To\\nreduce this complexity, a modern email client will do two things: pre-populate\\nthe sender (it can do this because it is aware of your email address), and provide\\nTESLER’S LAW | 109\\nsuggestions for the recipient as you begin to type their address, based on prior\\nemails and/or your contacts ( Figure 9-1). The complexity isn’t entirely gone; it’s\\njust abstracted away to reduce the effort required of the user. In other words, the\\nexperience of writing an email is made a little simpler by moving the complexity\\nof filling in the sender’s and, if possible, the recipient’s address to the email\\nclient, which was designed and developed by a team that assumed that burden of\\ncomplexity when building it.\\nFigure 9-1. Modern email clients reduce complexity by populating the “from” line and suggesting\\nthe “to” line based on prior emails (source: Gmail, 2023)\\nTaking that a step further, Gmail now leverages artificial intelligence (AI)\\nwithin your emails through a feature called Smart Compose  (Figure 9-2 ). This\\nintelligent feature can scan what you’ve typed and use that content to suggest\\nwords and phrases to finish your sentences, thus saving you additional typing\\nand time. It should be noted that Smart Compose is not the first time-saving\\nfeature introduced to Gmail by way of AI—there’s also Smart Reply, which scans\\nan email for context and suggests several relevant quick-reply options.\\n110 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 9-2. Example of Gmail’s Smart Compose feature (source: Gmail, 2023)\\nAnother place that Tesler’s law can commonly be observed is in the ubiqui-\\ntous checkout process found on online shopping sites. Purchasing items online\\nrequires customers to provide lots of repetitive information, including billing and\\nshipping details. To simplify this process for customers, it is common to see\\nonline stores enable users to have their shipping address inherit the information\\nfrom their billing address ( Figure 9-3). This option simplifies the checkout pro-\\ncess for customers in many cases because it prevents them from having to enter\\nduplicate information for shipping. The resulting experience for customers has\\nbeen effectively simplified, while the complexity required to enable the feature\\nhas shifted to the designers and developers responsible for implementing it up\\nfront. Simplifying the checkout process even further are services such as Apple\\nPay (Figure 9-4), which makes paying for items both online and in person even\\neasier for customers. Once they’ve set up an account, people using Apple Pay\\nor similar payment services can purchase items simply by selecting the option\\nduring checkout and verifying the details of their purchase—no need to enter\\nany additional information. The customer experience thus becomes significantly\\nless complex, with the complexity again shifted to the designers and developers\\nresponsible for the service.\\nTESLER’S LAW | 111\\nFigure 9-3. The ability to inherit a shipping address from billing details within an ecommerce\\ncheckout simplifies the process and removes the need to type redundant information\\nFigure 9-4. Apple Pay makes the checkout process as easy as selecting the payment option and\\nverifying your purchase (source: Apple, 2023)\\n112 | LAWS OF UX\\nRetail is an area in which you can find many innovative ways to abstract\\ncomplexity away from users. Take, for example, Amazon’s Go stores (Figure 9-5),\\nwhich provide a checkout-free shopping experience. First appearing as an experi-\\nment in downtown Seattle, they are now popping up in major metropolitan\\nareas all over the United States. With the Amazon Go app installed on their\\nsmartphone, a customer can simply check in with the app when they enter the\\nstore, grab what they need, and walk out, without ever needing to wait in line,\\nscan their items, or even pay in the store. A little later, the customer receives a\\nreceipt, and their Amazon account is charged.\\nFigure 9-5. The first Amazon Go store in Seattle\\n(source: Wikipedia, 2019; photographer, Brianc333a)\\nThe dizzying array of technology involved in a checkout-free shopping expe-\\nrience like that found in Amazon Go stores is nothing short of astounding.\\nAdvanced technology like machine learning, computer vision, and AI must be\\ndeeply integrated to allow for people to simply walk into the store, grab the\\nitems they wish to purchase, and then walk out. While the friction of shopping\\nis drastically reduced for customers, the complexity that comes along with it\\nmust be absorbed by the designers and developers responsible for ensuring it all\\nworks.\\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing a whole new\\ninteraction paradigm in computing history in which users can tell the computer\\nwhat outcome they want via natural language. This intent-based paradigm sits\\nin stark contrast to the command-based paradigm we’ve lived with for the last\\ncouple of decades, which requires commands via user actions within a graphical\\nTESLER’S LAW | 113\\nuser interface (GUI), resulting in feedback from the system. With intent-based\\ninteraction, the complexity of the system is abstracted away from the user, ena-\\nbling them to simply describe the outcome they’d like to see.  Take, for example,\\nSpark, from product analytics company Mixpanel, which enables users to con-\\nduct in-depth analyses of data by simply asking questions in natural language\\n(Figure 9-6).\\nFigure 9-6. Mixpanel’s natural language Spark feature (source: Mixpanel, 2023)\\nIntent-based interaction via natural language lowers the barrier of knowledge\\nrequired to interact with software, which is particularly effective with complex\\nproducts with sophisticated feature sets. This interaction paradigm democratizes\\naccess to software and empowers users who know what they want to do but\\ndon’t know how to do it to simply describe the outcome they’d like. The barrier\\nfor entry required of users to reach “power user” status fades away while giving\\nthem access to the same powerful features.\\n114 | LAWS OF UX\\n4 John M. Carroll and Mary Beth Rosson, “Paradox of the Active User, ” in Interfacing Thought: Cognitive\\nAspects of Human–Computer Interaction, ed. John M. Carroll (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987).\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nParadox of the Active User\\nWhen it comes to designing software, there’s a very important considera-\\ntion to remember: users never read software manuals but instead start\\nusing the software immediately. This happens because users are often\\nmotivated to complete their immediate tasks, and therefore they don’t\\nwant to spend time up front reading documentation. It is, of course, a\\nparadox, because users will save time in the long term if they first take\\ntime to learn and optimize around the system.\\nThis paradox was first introduced by Mary Beth Rosson and John\\nCarroll in 1987 to explain a common observation in several user studies\\ndone at the IBM User Interface Institute.4 They found that new users\\nwere not reading the manuals supplied with computers and instead\\nwould just get started using them, even if it meant getting into errors\\nand running into roadblocks.\\nThe lesson here is that we must remember to not build products\\nand services for an idealized, rational user, because people don’t always\\nbehave rationally in real life. Instead, we can account for this paradox by\\nmaking guidance accessible throughout the product experience. We can\\ndesign it to fit within the context of use so that it can help these active\\nnew users, no matter what path they choose to take (e.g., tooltips with\\nhelpful information).\\nTESLER’S LAW | 115\\nTECHNIQUE\\nProgressive Disclosure\\nProgressive disclosure is an interaction design technique that displays\\nonly important actions or content by default, while making additional fea-\\ntures or content easily accessible. The result is a more streamlined inter-\\nface that helps to keep the user’s attention focused by reducing clutter,\\nconfusion, and cognitive load. Anytime we use a dropdown, accordion,\\nor toggle that reveals content that is hidden by default, we are utilizing\\nprogressive disclosure. This strategy is incredibly useful for simplifying\\ndesigns because it enables us to defer less important actions, advanced\\nfeatures, or additional content to a secondary screen (like a dropdown,\\naccordion, or content toggle).\\nA great example of progressive disclosure can be found on Stripe’s\\nwebsite (Figure 9-7): when you hover the mouse over any item in the\\nprimary navigation, a menu will appear that reveals the various links in\\nthat category. Stripe has created a simple interface in which users can\\nquickly scan and find relevant information without needing to dig through\\na mountain of content in the process.\\nFigure 9-7. Progressive disclosure menu on Stripe.com (source: Stripe, 2023)\\n116 | LAWS OF UX\\nConclusion\\nTesler’s law is important for designers to be aware of because it relates to a\\nfundamental challenge we face throughout our work: how we manage complex-\\nity. We must first acknowledge that with any process, there will be a necessary\\namount of complexity that cannot be removed, no matter how simplified the\\nprocess becomes as a result of the design process. Everything from a humble\\nemail to a highly sophisticated checkout process will have inherent complexity\\nthat must be managed. As designers, we have a responsibility to remove inherent\\ncomplexity from our interfaces, or else we ship that complexity to our users. This\\ncan result in confusion, frustration, and a bad user experience. Where possible,\\ndesigners and developers should handle complexity.\\nTESLER’S LAW | 117\\n\\nDoherty Threshold\\nProductivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace\\n(<400 ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.\\nKey T akeaways\\n• Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep users’•\\nattention and increase productivity.\\n• Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce•\\nthe perception of waiting.\\n• Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or•\\nprocessing is happening in the background.\\n• Progress bars help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their•\\naccuracy.\\n• Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its•\\nperceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process\\nitself actually takes much less time.\\nOverview\\nOne of the features that is critical to good user experiences is performance.\\nEmotions can quickly turn to frustration and leave a negative lasting impact\\nwhen users who are trying to achieve a task are met with slow processing, lack of\\nfeedback, or excessive load times. Often overlooked as more a technical best prac-\\ntice, speed should be considered an essential design feature that is core to good\\n119\\n| 10\\nuser experiences. Whether it’s the amount of time the product or service takes\\nto initially load, how fast it is to respond to interactions and provide feedback, or\\nhow quickly subsequent pages load, the speed at which a system responds is key\\nto the overall user experience.\\nThere are several factors that can impact the performance of websites and\\napps, but the most significant is overall page weight, or the overall size of a\\npage as a result of its files, scripts, and media. Unfortunately, when it comes to\\npage weight on the web, the average has increased exponentially over the years.\\nAccording to the HTTP Archive, the average desktop page weight in 2023 was\\nmore than 2 MB (2286 KB), with mobile not too far behind at just over 2 MB\\n(2007 KB). This is a vast increase over the average page weights in 2010–2011:\\n634 KB on desktop and 260 KB on mobile (Figure 10-1).\\nFigure 10-1. Average page weight is increasing each year (source: HTTP Archive, 2023)\\nThis trend means longer wait times, and waiting is not something people\\nlike to do when trying to complete a task. Countless studies reinforce the fact that\\nthe longer the wait times that people are subjected to, the more likely it is they\\nwill grow frustrated and even abandon the task altogether.\\nAdditionally, slow response times from a system lead to a decrease in the\\nproductivity of the people using an interface. While a 100 ms response feels\\ninstantaneous, a delay of between 100 and 300 ms begins to be perceptible to the\\nhuman eye, and people begin to feel less in control. Once the delay extends past\\n1,000 ms (1 second), people begin thinking about other things; their attention\\nwanders, and information important to performing their task begins to get lost,\\nleading to an inevitable reduction in performance. The cognitive load required\\nto continue with the task increases as a result, and the overall user experience\\nsuffers.\\n120 | LAWS OF UX\\n1 The original study has been lost to time, but you can read a copy of it on Jim Elliott’s Mainframe Blog:\\nhttps:/ /oreil.ly/8Gpua.\\n2 Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (New Y ork: Harper & Row, 1990).\\nOrigins\\nIn the early days of desktop computing, two seconds was considered an accept-\\nable threshold for response time from a computer when performing a task.\\nThe reason for this widely accepted standard was that it provided time for the\\nuser to think about their next task. Then, in 1982, two IBM employees, Walter\\nJ. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani, published a study called “The Economic\\nValue of Rapid Response Time” in the IBM Systems Journal  that challenged this\\nprevious standard by stating that “productivity increases in more than direct\\nproportion to a decrease in response time” when the threshold is under 400\\nms.1 The authors of the study claimed that “when a computer and its users\\ninteract at a pace that ensures that neither has to wait on the other, productivity\\nsoars, the cost of the work done on the computer tumbles, employees get more\\nsatisfaction from their work, and its quality tends to improve.” Their study set\\na new standard that would come to be known as the Doherty threshold, based\\non Doherty’s observation that computer response times have a disproportionate\\nimpact on productivity.\\nPSYCHOLOGY CONCEPT\\nFlow\\nFlow is a mental state in which a person performing an activity is\\nfully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and\\nenjoyment in the process of the activity. Coined by psychologist Mihály\\nCsíkszentmihályi in 1970, it has been widely referred to across a variety\\nof fields (and is particularly well recognized in occupational therapy),\\nthough the concept has been claimed to have existed for thousands of\\nyears under other names.2\\nFlow is the state that occurs when there is a balance between the\\ndifficulty of a task and the level of skill at the given task. It’s characterized\\nby intense and focused concentration on the present, combined with a\\nsense of total control. For example, a task that’s too difficult can lead to\\nheightened frustration, while a task that’s too easy can lead to boredom.\\nDOHERTY THRESHOLD | 121\\n3 Joshua Gold and Joseph Ciorciari, “A Review on the Role of the Neuroscience of Flow States in the Modern\\nWorld, ” Behavioral Sciences 10, no. 9 (2020): 137 , https:/ /doi.org/10.3390/bs10090137.\\nFinding the right balance requires matching the challenge with the skill of\\nthe user. When users find themselves in a flow state, they are completely\\nabsorbed by their tasks, free from inner criticism, and up to five times\\nmore productive.3\\nWe can design for flow by providing the necessary feedback so that\\nthe user knows what action has been done and what has been accom-\\nplished, optimizing for efficiency and system responsiveness by remov-\\ning any unnecessary friction, and making content and features available\\nfor discovery to avoid disengagement with the interface.\\nExamples\\nIn some cases, the amount of time required for processing is longer than what\\nis prescribed by the Doherty threshold (i.e., >400 ms), and there simply isn’t\\nmuch that can be done about it. But that doesn’t mean we can’t provide feedback\\nto users in a timely fashion while the necessary processing is happening in the\\nbackground. This technique helps to create the perception that a website or an\\napp is performing faster than it actually is.\\n122 | LAWS OF UX\\nOne common example used by platforms such as Instagram ( Figure 10-2)\\nis the presentation of a skeleton screen when content is loading. This technique\\nmakes the site appear to load faster by instantly displaying placeholder blocks\\nin the areas where content will eventually appear. The blocks are progressively\\nreplaced with actual text and images once they are loaded. This reduces the\\nimpression of waiting, which increases the perception of speed and responsive-\\nness even if the content is loading slowly. Additionally, skeleton screens prevent\\nthe jarring and disorienting experience of content jumping around as adjacent\\nmaterial loads by reserving space for each item up front.\\nFigure 10-2. Instagram’s skeleton screen helps the site appear to load faster\\n(source: Instagram, 2023)\\nDOHERTY THRESHOLD | 123\\n4 Brad A. Myers, “The Importance of Percent-Done Progress Indicators for Computer–Human Interfaces, ”\\nin CHI ’85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New Y ork:\\nAssociation for Computing Machinery, 1985), 11–17 .\\nAnother way to optimize load times is known as the “blur up” technique.\\nThis approach focuses specifically on images, which are often the main contribu-\\ntor to excessively long load times in both web and native applications. It works\\nby first loading an extremely small version of an image and scaling it up in\\nthe space where the larger image will eventually be loaded. A Gaussian blur is\\napplied to eliminate any obvious pixelation and noise as a result of scaling up\\nthe low-resolution image ( Figure 10-3 ).  Once the larger version of the image\\nis loaded in the background, it is placed behind the low-resolution version and\\nrevealed by fading out the top image. Not only does this technique ensure faster\\nload times by prioritizing performance over content, but it also allocates room\\nfor full-sized images up front to prevent page jumping once the high-resolution\\nversion of the image is fully loaded.\\nFigure 10-3. Unsplash uses the “blur up” technique to enable faster page loading\\n(source: Unsplash.com, 2023)\\nAnimation is yet another way to visually engage people while loading or pro-\\ncessing is happening in the background. A common example is “percent-done\\nprogress indicators,” also known as progress bars. Research has shown that sim-\\nply seeing a progress bar can make wait times seem more tolerable, regardless of\\nits accuracy.4\\n124 | LAWS OF UX\\nThis simple UI pattern is effective for several reasons:\\n• It reassures people that their action is being processed.•\\n• It provides visual interest while they wait.•\\n• It reduces the perception of waiting by shifting focus to the animation of•\\nthe progress bar as opposed to the actual process of waiting.\\nWhile we can’t always circumvent the need for processing and the subse-\\nquent waiting, we can increase the user’s willingness to wait by providing visual\\nfeedback.\\nAn example of animation being used to reduce the uncertainty and frustra-\\ntion associated with wait times can be found in Google’s famous email client,\\nGmail (Figure 10-4). The loading screen uses an animated version of its logo in\\ncombination with a simple progress bar while the app loads.  The effect of this\\nsimple yet distinctive animation creates the perception of a shorter wait time and\\nimproves the overall user experience by reassuring people that the app is loading. \\nFigure 10-4. Gmail uses a simple yet distinctive animation to shorten the perceived wait time\\n(source: Gmail, 2023)\\nDOHERTY THRESHOLD | 125\\n5 Robert B. Miller, “Response Time in Man–Computer Conversational T ransactions, ” in Proceedings of\\nthe December 9–11, 1968, Fall Joint Computer Conference, Part I, vol. 33 (New Y ork: Association for\\nComputing Machinery, 1968), 267–77 .\\nTen seconds is the commonly recognized limit for keeping the user’s atten-\\ntion focused on the task at hand—anything exceeding this limit, and they’ll want\\nto perform other tasks while waiting. 5 When wait times must extend beyond the\\nmaximum of ten seconds, progress bars are still helpful but should be augmen-\\nted with an estimation of the time remaining until completion and a description\\nof the task that is currently being performed. This additional information helps\\ngive users an idea of how much time they have to wait until the task is finished\\nand frees them up to do other tasks in the meantime. Take, for example, Apple’s\\ninstallation screen (Figure 10-5), which is displayed when an update is underway.\\nFigure 10-5. Apple provides an estimated time to completion along with a progress bar\\nduring updates (source: Apple macOS)\\nAnother clever technique for improving perceived performance is the opti-\\nmistic UI . It works by optimistically providing feedback that an action was\\nsuccessful while it is being processed, as opposed to providing feedback only\\nonce the action has been completed. For example, Instagram displays comments\\non photos before they are actually posted ( Figure 10-6 ). This makes the app’s\\nresponse time seem faster than it actually is: it immediately provides visual feed-\\nback that assumes the comment will be successfully posted, and only displays\\nan error afterward in the event that the action isn’t successful. The required\\nprocessing still happens in the background, but the user’s perception of the app’s\\nperformance is improved.\\n126 | LAWS OF UX\\nFigure 10-6. Instagram optimistically displays comments on photos before they are actually\\nposted to improve perceived performance (source: Instagram, 2023)\\nKEY CONSIDERATION\\nFriction\\nMost issues around response times boil down to them being too slow. It\\nmight seem counterintuitive, but it’s important to also consider when\\nresponse times might be too fast. When the system responds more\\nquickly than the user expects it to, a few problems can occur. First, a\\nchange that happens a little too fast may be completely missed—this\\nis especially true when the change is not the result of an action taken\\nby the user but something that happens automatically. Another issue\\nthat can occur when a response time is too fast is that it can be difficult\\nfor the user to comprehend what happened, since the speed of the\\nchange does not allow sufficient time for mental processing. Finally, a\\ntoo-fast response time can result in mistrust if it doesn’t align with the\\nuser’s expectations about the task being performed. Purposefully adding\\na delay to a process can actually increase its perceived value and instill\\nDOHERTY THRESHOLD | 127\\n6 Mark Wilson, “The UX Secret That Will Ruin Apps for Y ou, ” Fast Company, July 6, 2016,\\nhttps:/ /oreil.ly/meoX2.\\na sense of trust, even when the process actually takes much less time.6\\nFriction can be carefully utilized when a more considered response is\\nrequired from users. T ake, for example, a confirmation modal, which\\ncan be enough friction to activate the effortful and evaluative mental\\nprocess known as System 2 thinking (see Chapter 7 , “Aesthetic–Usability\\nEffect”), and thus decrease the likelihood of mistakes or errors. Another\\nexample is Google’s Privacy Checkup process (Figure 10-7), which scans\\nyour account for potential privacy vulnerabilities. Google uses it as an\\nopportunity to educate people about what is being scanned and adds\\nadditional time to the process to instill trust that the scan is thorough.\\nFigure 10-7. Google’s Privacy Checkup process scans your account for potential\\nprivacy vulnerabilities, extending the time the process actually requires and taking\\nthe opportunity to educate you (source: Google, 2023)\\n128 | LAWS OF UX\\nConclusion\\nPerformance is not just a technical consideration for our development collea-\\ngues—it is an essential design feature. As designers, it is our responsibility to\\nhelp ensure the people who use our products and services can achieve their tasks\\nas quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end, it’s important that we provide\\nthe appropriate feedback, leverage perceived performance, and use progress bars\\nto reduce the overall sense of waiting.\\nDOHERTY THRESHOLD | 129\\n\\nApplying\\nPsychological\\nPrinciples in Design\\nThe wealth of knowledge afforded to designers by behavioral and cognitive psy-\\nchology research provides an invaluable foundation for creating human-centered\\nuser experiences. Much like how an architect with an intimate knowledge of\\nhow people experience space will create better buildings, designers with an\\nunderstanding of how humans behave will create better designs. The challenge\\nbecomes how to build that intimate knowledge and make it part of the design\\nprocess. In this chapter, we’ll explore some ways designers can internalize and\\napply the psychological principles we’ve looked at in this book and then articulate\\nthem through design principles that relate back to the goals and priorities of their\\nteams.\\nBuilding Awareness\\nBuilding awareness is perhaps the most obvious but effective way for designers\\nto internalize and apply the psychological concepts covered in this book. The\\nfollowing are a few strategies I’ve seen implemented within teams to do this.\\nVISIBILITY\\nThe first and easiest way to internalize the principles discussed in this book is\\nto make them visible in your working space. Since launching my Laws of UX\\nproject, I’ve received countless photos from teams that have printed out each of\\nthe posters available on the website and put them up on the walls for everyone\\nto see (Figure 11-1). It makes me incredibly proud to see my work on office walls\\nall around the world, but I also realize it serves a functional purpose: building\\n131\\n| 11\\nawareness. By being constantly visible to the teams, these posters help to remind\\nthem of the various psychological principles that can help guide decisions during\\nthe design process. In addition to this, the posters serve as a reminder of the\\nway humans perceive and process information. The result is a shared collective\\nknowledge and vocabulary around these principles that’s cultivated within the\\norganization. Ultimately, this leads to team members capable of articulating the\\nprinciples and how they can be applied to the design work being produced.\\nFigure 11-1. Laws of UX posters helping to build awareness\\n(sources: Xtian Miller of Vectorform [left], and Virginia Virduzzo of Rankia [right])\\nSHOW-AND-TELL\\nAnother method for building awareness within teams on any topic is the classic\\nshow-and-tell: the practice of showing something to an audience and telling them\\nabout it. Like many of you, I was first exposed to this activity in my early years\\nthrough school, and it’s always been something I’ve enjoyed. Grade school teach-\\ners often use this activity as a way to teach students about public speaking, but\\nit’s also a great format for team members to share knowledge and learnings\\namong themselves.\\nThe design teams I’ve been part of that have established a regular dedicated\\ntime for knowledge sharing have benefited from this practice in a number of\\nways. First, it’s an effective way to share information that could be useful to other\\nteam members. It’s a low-cost means of distributing information in a format\\nthat’s likely to be remembered. Everything from design techniques and new tools\\nto usability test findings and project recaps—and yes, psychology principles—will\\nbe valuable to someone on the team. Additionally, show-and-tells are great for\\nbuilding speaking confidence in team members and giving people an opportu-\\nnity to establish themselves as subject matter experts, and they indicate an overall\\n132 | LAWS OF UX\\ndedication to and investment in continual learning on the part of the organiza-\\ntion. It’s about creating a culture of dialogue and knowledge building within the\\nteam, which I’ve found means a lot to team members, myself included.\\nWhile simply building awareness might not firmly embed these principles\\ninto the design process of an entire team, it definitely can help influence design\\ndecisions. Next up, we’ll take a look at how these principles can be made instru-\\nmental to the design process within a team, and how to  further embed them into\\ndecision making.\\nDesign Principles\\nAs design teams grow, the number of design decisions that must be made on a\\ndaily basis will increase proportionally. More often than not, this responsibility\\nwill land on design leadership, who must shoulder it alongside their numerous\\nother responsibilities. Once the team reaches a certain threshold and the vol-\\nume of design decisions to be made exceeds what is possible for leadership to\\nmanage, the output of the team will slow down and become blocked. Another\\nscenario could be that design decisions are made by individual team members\\nwithout approval, and therefore without the assurance that their decisions meet\\nthe standard of quality, objectives, or overall design vision of the team. In other\\nwords, design gatekeepers can become an obstacle to consistency and scalability.\\nTo add to this problem, the priorities and values of the team can become less\\nclear, resulting in individual team members defining what good design looks like\\nto them, not necessarily to the overall team. I’ve seen this happen firsthand, and\\nas you might imagine, it’s problematic, because the definition of “good design”\\nwithin the team becomes a moving target. The result is less consistent output\\nfrom the team overall. The output of the team will inevitably suffer as a result of\\ninconsistency and lack of a clear vision.\\nOne of the most effective ways we can ensure consistent decision making\\nwithin the design process is by establishing design principles: a set of guidelines\\nthat represent the priorities and goals of a design team and serve as a foundation\\nfor reasoning for decision making. They help to frame how a team approaches\\nproblems and what it values. As a team grows and the amount of decisions to\\nbe made increases proportionally, design principles can serve as a North Star:\\nguiding values that embody what good design looks like for the team. Gatekeep-\\ners are no longer a bottleneck, as the team has a shared understanding of what\\na successful design solution looks like in the context of these shared values and\\ngoals. Design decisions become quicker and more consistent, and the team has\\nAPPLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES IN DESIGN | 133\\na common mindset and overall design vision. When done correctly, the ultimate\\nimpact this has on a team is profound and has the potential to influence the\\nentire organization.\\nNext, we’ll take a look at how you can begin to define your team’s guiding\\nvalues and resulting design principles in order to ultimately connect these to\\nfoundational psychological principles.\\nDEFINING YOUR PRINCIPLES\\nYou can use a variety of methods to define a set of design principles that reflect\\nyour team’s goals and priorities. While a comprehensive look at the various ways\\nto enable team collaboration and orchestrate workshops is outside the scope of\\nthis book, it’s worth giving some context. The following is a common process for\\ndefining a team’s guiding design principles:\\nIdentify the team\\nDefining design principles is commonly done during a workshop or series\\nof workshop activities, so the first step is to identify the team members who\\nwill participate. A common approach is to keep things open to anyone who\\nwishes to contribute—especially those whose work will be directly affected\\nby the principles. It may also be a good idea to open the process to design\\nleadership and stakeholders outside of the immediate team, as they will\\nbring a different perspective that’s also valuable. The more people you can\\nget involved, the easier it will be to ensure widespread adoption.\\nAlign and define\\nOnce the team is identified, it’s time to carve out some time and kick\\nthings off by first aligning on success criteria. This means not only creating\\na shared understanding of design principles and the purpose they serve,\\nbut also defining the goals of the exercise—for example, defining what\\ncriteria each design principle must meet to be valuable for the team.\\nDiverge\\nThe next step is commonly centered around idea generation. Each team\\nmember is asked to brainstorm as many design principles as they can for\\na defined amount of time (say, 10–15 minutes), writing each idea on a\\nseparate sticky note. By the end of this exercise, each participant should\\nhave a stack of ideas.\\n134 | LAWS OF UX\\nConverge\\nAfter divergence comes convergence, so the next step is to bring all those\\nideas together and identify themes. Participants are usually asked during\\nthis phase to share their ideas with the group and to organize those ideas\\naccording to themes that surface during the exercise, with the help of a\\nfacilitator. After all the participants have shared their ideas, they are asked\\nto vote on the themes they feel are the most appropriate for the team and\\nthe organization. A common exercise for this is “dot voting,” where each\\nperson receives a finite number of adhesive dots (usually 5–10) that they\\nuse to vote. The themes they choose to vote on are entirely up to them, and\\nthey can even use multiple dots on a single theme if they feel particularly\\nstrongly about it.\\nRefine and apply\\nThe next step will vary per team, but it’s common to first undergo a refine-\\nment stage and then identify how the principles can be applied. Themes\\nshould be consolidated where possible and then articulated clearly. Next,\\nit’s a good idea to identify where and how these principles can be applied\\nwithin the team and throughout the organization as a whole.\\nCirculate and advocate\\nThe final step is to share the principles and advocate for their adoption. Cir-\\nculation can come in many forms: posters, desktop wallpapers, notebooks,\\nand shared team documentation are all common media. The goal here is\\nto make them readily accessible and visible to all members of the design\\nteam. Additionally, it’s critical that team members who participated in the\\nworkshop advocate for these principles both within and outside the team.\\nBEST PRACTICES\\nDesign principles are valuable only when they can effectively provide guidance\\nand frame decision making. The following are a few best practices to help ensure\\nthe design principles your team adopts are useful:\\nGood design principles aren’t truisms\\nGood design principles are direct, clear, and actionable, not bland and\\nobvious. Truisms can’t help with decision making because they are too\\nvague and lack a clear stance (for example, “design should be intuitive”).\\nAPPLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES IN DESIGN | 135\\nGood design principles solve real questions\\nYou’ll want to make sure the principles you define can clearly resolve real\\nquestions and drive design decisions. Be careful, though—you don’t want\\nthem to become too scenario-specific.\\nGood design principles are opinionated\\nThe principles you define should have a focus and a sense of prioritization,\\nwhich will push the team in the right direction when needed and drive\\nthem to say no when necessary.\\nGood design principles are memorable\\nDesign principles that are hard to remember are less likely to be used.\\nThey should feel relevant to the needs and ambitions of the team and the\\norganization as a whole.\\nCONNECTING PRINCIPLES TO LAWS\\nOnce your team has established a set of design principles, consider each princi-\\nple in light of the psychological principles discussed in this book. By doing this,\\nyou can make the connection between what the design principle is seeking to\\naccomplish and the psychological reasoning behind it. Suppose, for example, that\\nyour design principle is “clarity over abundance of choice.” This principle is quite\\nuseful because it not only prioritizes clarity but also establishes the trade-off (loss\\nof abundant choice). To align this principle with a law, we must identify the one\\nthat most relates to this goal of providing clarity. Hick’s law ( Chapter 4), which\\nstates that “the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and\\ncomplexity of choices available,” seems to be a good match in this case.\\nOnce the connection is made between a design principle and the appropriate\\npsychological law, the next step is to establish a rule for team members to follow\\nin the context of the product or service. Rules help to provide constraints that\\nguide design decisions in a more prescriptive way. Continuing with the previous\\nexample, we’ve identified Hick’s law as the appropriate law to connect to our\\ndesign principle of “clarity over abundance of choice,” and we can now deduce\\nrules that are appropriate for that design principle. For example, one rule that\\naligns with this law would be to “limit choices to no more than three items at\\na time.” Another rule that could be appropriate is to “provide brief explanations\\nwhen useful that are clear and no more than 80 characters.” These are simple\\nexamples that are meant to illustrate the point—the ones you’d define would be\\nappropriate for your project or organization.\\n136 | LAWS OF UX\\nWe now have a clear framework ( Figure 11-2) that consists of a goal (design\\nprinciple) and an observation (law) and establishes guidelines (rules) that design-\\ners can follow to meet this goal. You can repeat this process for each of the\\ndesign principles that your team has agreed upon to create a comprehensive\\ndesign framework.\\nFigure 11-2. An example design principle, observation, and rules\\nLet’s take a look at another example: “familiarity over novelty.” This passes\\nthe criteria we’ve set for what a good design principle should be, so it’s time\\nto identify the law that most relates to this goal of providing familiarity. Jakob’s\\nlaw ( Chapter 1 ), which states that “users spend most of their time on other\\nsites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they\\nalready know,” is a pretty good match. The next step is to establish rules for team\\nmembers to follow in order to provide further guidance and ensure the principle\\nis actionable. Familiarity is supported by the use of common design patterns,\\nso we’ll start by establishing that we should “use common design patterns to\\nreinforce familiarity with the interface.” Next, we can further recommend that\\ndesigners “avoid distracting the user with a flashy UI or quirky animations.”\\nOnce again, we now have a clear framework ( Figure 11-3) that consists of a goal\\nand an observation and establishes rules that designers can follow to meet this\\ngoal.\\nFigure 11-3. Another example design principle, observation, and rules\\nAPPLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES IN DESIGN | 137\\nConclusion\\nThe most effective way to leverage psychology in the design process is to embed\\nit into everyday decision making. In this chapter, we explored a few ways\\ndesigners can internalize and apply the psychological principles we’ve looked\\nat in this book and then articulate them through design principles that relate\\nback to your team’s goals and priorities. We started by looking at how you can\\nbuild awareness through making these principles visible in your working space.\\nNext, we looked at a simple method for cultivating a culture of dialogue and\\nknowledge building within the team through the classic show-and-tell format.\\nLast, we explored the value and benefits of design principles, how to establish\\ndesign principles, and how to make the connection between what each principle\\nis seeking to accomplish and the psychological reasoning behind it. You can do\\nthis by establishing the goal, the psychological observation that supports this\\ngoal, and finally the means by which it will be applied through design. Once this\\nprocess is complete, your team will have a clear road map that not only lays out\\nits shared values through a set of clear design guidelines but also provides both\\nthe psychological validation to support these guidelines and an agreed-upon set\\nof rules that help ensure the team can consistently meet them. \\n138 | LAWS OF UX\\nWith Power Comes\\nResponsibility\\nIn the previous chapters, we looked at how to leverage psychology to build\\nmore intuitive, human-centered products and experiences. We identified and\\nexplored some key principles from psychology that can be used as a guide for\\ndesigning for how people actually are, instead of forcing them to conform to\\ntechnology. This knowledge can be quite powerful for designers, but with power\\ncomes responsibility. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with leveraging the\\ninsights from behavioral and cognitive psychology to help create better designs,\\nit’s critical that we consider how products and services have the potential to\\nundermine the goals and objectives of the people using them , why accountability\\nis critical for those creating those products and services, and how we can slow\\ndown and be more intentional.\\nHow T echnology Shapes Behavior\\nThe first step in making more responsible design decisions is to acknowledge\\nand understand the ways in which the human mind is susceptible to persuasive\\ntechnology and how behavior can be shaped. There are a number of studies that\\nprovide a glimpse into the fundamentals of behavior shaping, but perhaps none\\nare as influential or foundational as those conducted by American psychologist,\\nbehaviorist, author, inventor, and social philosopher B. F. Skinner. Through a\\nprocess he called “operant conditioning,” Skinner studied how behaviors could\\nbe learned and modified by creating an association between a particular behavior\\nand a consequence. Using a laboratory apparatus that came to be named after\\nhim (Figure 12-1), Skinner studied how the behavior of animals could be shaped\\nby teaching them to perform desired actions in response to specific stimuli in\\nan isolated environment. His earliest experiments involved placing a hungry rat\\n139\\n| 12\\n1 B. F . Skinner, The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis (New Y ork: Appleton-Century, 1938).\\ninto the chamber and observing it while it discovered that a food pellet would\\nbe dispensed when it came into contact with a lever on one side. 1 After a few\\nchance occurrences, the rat quickly learned the association between pushing\\nthe lever and receiving food, and each time it was put in the box it would\\ngo straight to the lever—a clear demonstration of how positive reinforcement\\nincreases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated. Skinner  also experimented\\nwith negative reinforcement by placing a rat inside the chamber and subjecting it\\nto an unpleasant electrical current, which would be turned off when the lever was\\npressed. Much like the results of his previous experiments that rewarded the rats\\nwith food, the animal learned to avoid the current quickly by going straight to the\\nlever once placed in the box.\\nFigure 12-1. B. F. Skinner’s operant conditioning chamber, also known as the “Skinner box”\\n(source: Skinner, 1938)\\n140 | LAWS OF UX\\n2 C. B. Ferster and B. F . Skinner, Schedules of Reinforcement (New Y ork: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1957).\\n3 Natasha Dow Schüll, Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas (Princeton, NJ: Princeton\\nUniversity Press, 2012).\\nSkinner later discovered that different patterns of reinforcement affected the\\nspeed and frequency at which the animals would perform the desired behavior. 2\\nFor example, rats that were rewarded with food every time they pressed the lever\\nwould press it only when they became hungry, and rats that were rewarded\\ntoo infrequently would stop pressing the lever altogether. By contrast, rats that\\nwere rewarded with food in unpredictable patterns would repeatedly press the\\nlever and continue doing so without reinforcement for the longest time. In other\\nwords, the rats’ behavior could most effectively be shaped by reinforcing it at vari-\\nable times, as opposed to every time or not frequently enough. Too much or too\\nlittle reinforcement led to the animals losing interest, but random reinforcement\\nled to impulsive, repeated behavior.\\nFast-forward to today, and it’s clear that Skinner’s research has been applied\\nbeyond the isolated box that bears his name. It can also be observed with human\\nsubjects in casinos around the world, where you’ll find slot machines that have\\nperfected operant conditioning. These machines are an excellent modern-day\\nexample of the Skinner box: gamblers pay to pull a lever, occasionally being\\nrewarded for doing so. In her book Addiction by Design ,3 cultural anthropolo-\\ngist Natasha Dow Schüll explores the world of machine-aided gambling and\\ndescribes how slot machines are designed to mesmerize people into a state of\\n“continuous productivity” in order to extract maximum value through a continual\\nfeedback loop. Additionally, their activity is often recorded into a data system that\\ncreates a risk profile for each player, informing the casino observers how much\\nthe player can lose and still feel satisfied. When a player approaches their algo-\\nrithmically calculated “pain point,” casinos often dispatch a “luck ambassador” to\\nsupplement the holding power of the slot machine by dispensing meal coupons,\\nshow tickets, gambling vouchers, and other incentives. It’s a stimulus–response\\nloop that’s optimized to keep people in front of the machines, repeatedly pulling\\nthe levers and spending money—all while being tracked in order to maximize\\ntheir time on the device.\\nDigital products and services have also been known to employ various meth-\\nods with the goal of shaping human behavior, and we can see examples in many\\nof the apps we use every day. Everything from keeping you on a site for as long as\\npossible to nudging you to make a purchase or tempting you to share content is\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 141\\n4 Michael Winnick and Robert Zolna, “Putting a Finger on Our Phone Obsession, ” dscout, June 16, 2016,\\nhttps:/ /oreil.ly/eKBeX.\\nbehavior that can be shaped through reinforcement at the right time. Let’s take a\\ncloser look at some of the more common methods technology employs to shape\\nbehavior, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\\nINTERMITTENT VARIABLE REWARDS\\nSkinner demonstrated that random reinforcement on a variable schedule is the\\nmost effective way to influence behavior. Digital platforms can also shape behav-\\nior through the use of variable rewards, and this can be observed each time\\nwe check our phones for notifications, scroll through a feed, or pull to refresh.\\nThe results are similar to what Skinner observed in his lab: studies show that\\nthe average person interacts with their smartphone over 2,500 times a day, and\\nsome people up to 5,400 times, amounting to two to four hours each day. 4 Let’s\\nlook at a specific example that demonstrates variable rewards: pull to refresh\\n(Figure 12-2). This common interaction pattern is used by many mobile apps to\\nenable the loading of new content by swiping down on the screen when at the\\ntop of a content feed. It doesn’t take a stretch of the imagination to see the simi-\\nlarities between this and a slot machine—not only in the physical interaction, but\\nalso in the variable “reward” it generates.\\nFigure 12-2. Pull-to-refresh example on Instagram (source: Instagram, 2023)\\n142 | LAWS OF UX\\nINFINITE LOOPS\\nInfinite loops such as autoplay videos (Figure 12-3) and infinite scrolling feeds are\\ndesigned to maximize time on site by removing friction. Without the need for the\\nuser to make a conscious decision to load more content or play that next video,\\ncompanies can ensure that passive consumption on their sites or apps continues\\nuninterrupted. Ads are typically interspersed with the looping content, so more\\ntime on site means more ads viewed—a model that is significantly more effective\\nin generating revenue than displaying static ads.\\nFigure 12-3. YouTube autoplays the next video (source: YouTube, 2023)\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 143\\n5 Catalina L. T oma and Jeffrey T . Hancock, “Self-Affirmation Underlies Facebook Use, ” Personality and\\nSocial Psychology Bulletin 39, no. 3 (2013): 321–31.\\nSOCIAL AFFIRMATION\\nWe humans are inherently social creatures. The drive to fulfill our core needs\\nfor a sense of self-worth and integrity extends to our lives on social media, 5\\nwhere we seek social rewards ( Figure 12-4). Each “like” or positive comment we\\nreceive on content we post online temporarily satisfies our desire for approval\\nand belonging. Such social affirmation delivers a side dish of dopamine, the\\nchemical produced by our brains that plays a key role in motivating behavior.\\nFigure 12-4. Facebook’s “like” button, first introduced in 2009 and now a ubiquitous feature in\\nsocial media (source: Facebook, 2023)\\n144 | LAWS OF UX\\nPERSONALIZATION\\nSocial media platforms frequently make use of machine learning algorithms to\\npersonalize experiences through predictive recommendations. They do this by\\ncollecting data that simultaneously uses the results to improve itself, producing\\na feedback loop of random reinforcement. More time spent interacting with\\ncontent within the platform increases algorithmic quality, resulting in more\\ntime spent on the platform, more data signals collected, and more ads viewed.\\nThe more personalization a platform can achieve, the more relevance for users,\\nwhich leads to more time spent on the platform and improved conversion rates.\\nTake, for example, TikTok, which utilizes its interface to capture data signals in\\nthe form of user interaction in order to personalize content recommendations\\nengineered to keep users on the platform longer ( Figure 12-5). The unfortunate\\ndownside to this degree of personalization is that it can lure users deep into\\nan addictive rabbit hole of increasingly extreme content or expose them to infor-\\nmation and opinions that conform to and reinforce their preexisting beliefs and\\nbiases (commonly referred to as a filter bubble ). Additionally, research suggests\\nthis sort of content consumption can lead to a significant decrease in attention\\nspan and working memory.\\nFigure 12-5. TikTok’s personalized content recommendations powered\\nby machine learning algorithms (source: Tiktok, 2023)\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 145\\n6 Y abing Liu, Krishna P .

Johnson, Daniel G. Goldstein, and Kaiya Liu, “Partitioning Default Effects: Why People\\nChoose Not to Choose, ” Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied 17 , no. 4 (2011): 332–41.\\nDEFAULTS\\nDefault settings matter when it comes to choice architecture because most people\\nnever change them. These settings, therefore, have incredible power to steer\\ndecisions, even when people are unaware of what’s being decided for them. As\\na result, defaults can often exert influence over people in a way that’s not always\\naligned with their best interest. For example, a 2011 study found that Facebook’s\\ndefault privacy settings ( Figure 12-6 ) matched users’ expectations only 37% of\\nthe time, leading to their content and personal information being visible to more\\npeople than they expected.6\\nFigure 12-6. Facebook’s privacy settings (source: Facebook, 2023)\\nDespite these potential mismatches, studies suggest that default options\\noften lead people to rationalize their acceptance and reject alternatives.7\\n146 | LAWS OF UX\\n(LACK OF) FRICTION\\nAnother way to shape behavior with digital products and services is to remove\\nas much friction as possible—especially friction around actions you want people\\nto take. In other words, the easier and more convenient you make an action, the\\nmore likely people will be to perform that action and form a habit around it.\\nTake, for example, Amazon Dash buttons ( Figure 12-7), small electronic devices\\nthat enabled customers to order frequently used products simply by pressing a\\nbutton, without even visiting the Amazon website or app. The physical buttons\\nhave since been deprecated in favor of digital-only versions, but this example\\nillustrates just how far companies will go to shape behavior by attempting to\\nremove as many obstacles as possible.\\nFigure 12-7. An example of Amazon’s now-deprecated Dash button (source: Amazon, 2019)\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 147\\nRECIPROCITY\\nReciprocation, or the tendency to repay the gestures of others, is a strong impulse\\nwe share as human beings. It’s a social norm we’ve come to value and even rely\\non as a species. It’s also a strong determining factor of human behavior that\\ncan be exploited, intentionally or not. Technology can tap into our impulse to\\nreciprocate the gestures of others and shape our behavior as a result. Take, for\\nexample, LinkedIn, which utilizes reciprocity to keep users coming back to the\\nplatform in order to accept a connection request, respond to a direct message,\\nor endorse someone back for a skill. When someone invites you to connect on\\nLinkedIn, they may not have actively chosen to invite you but instead are simply\\nresponding to the platform’s list of suggested contacts ( Figure 12-8 ). In other\\nwords, your own unconscious desire to add someone may turn into a social\\nobligation that the other person feels compelled to reciprocate. The end result is\\nmore time spent on the platform by both people and more profit for LinkedIn.\\nFigure 12-8. LinkedIn connection request notification (source: LinkedIn, 2023)\\nDARK PATTERNS\\nDark patterns are yet another way technology can be used to influence behavior,\\nby making people perform actions that they didn’t intend to for the sake of\\nincreasing engagement or to convince users to complete a task that is not in their\\nbest interest (make a larger purchase, share unnecessary information, accept\\nmarketing communications, etc.). Unfortunately, these deceptive techniques can\\nbe found all over the internet. In a 2019 study, researchers from Princeton\\nUniversity and the University of Chicago analyzed about 11,000 shopping web-\\nsites looking for evidence of dark patterns. Their findings were nothing short of\\nalarming: they identified 1,818 instances of dark patterns, with the more popular\\n148 | LAWS OF UX\\n8 Arunesh Mathur, Gunes Acar, Michael J.

An example of the forced action dark pattern (source: Instagram, 2023)\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 149\\nThese are only some of the more common methods by which technology can\\nbe used to shape behavior in subtle ways. Data collected about user behavior can\\nbe used to fine-tune how a system responds to an individual, and these methods\\nare constantly increasing in sophistication and accuracy, while the psychological\\nhardware we share as humans remains the same. Now, more than ever, it’s\\nimportant that designers consider the ethics of influencing behavior.\\nWhy Ethics Matter\\nNow let’s explore why exploitative technology should matter to those in the\\ntechnology industry. It seems as if digital technology grows increasingly more\\nembedded in our daily lives with each passing year. Since the arrival of the\\nsmartphone and other “smart” devices, we’ve become more and more reliant\\non the miniaturized computers we keep in our pockets, wear on our wrists,\\nembed in our clothing, or carry in our bags. Everything from transportation\\nand accommodation to food and consumer goods is just a few taps and swipes\\naway, all thanks to these convenient little digital companions. The convenience\\nthese devices bring us is liberating and empowering, but it is not without conse-\\nquences. Sometimes companies with the best of intentions create technology that\\nultimately produces unintended results.\\nGOOD INTENTIONS, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES\\nCompanies seldom set out to create harmful products and services. When Face-\\nbook introduced the “like” button in 2009, it probably didn’t intend for the\\nfeature to become such an addictive feedback mechanism, providing a small\\ndopamine hit of social affirmation to users who found themselves returning to\\nthe app time and time again to measure their self-worth. Facebook probably also\\ndidn’t intend for people to spend so many hours mindlessly scrolling through\\ntheir news feeds once infinite scrolling was introduced. Snapchat probably didn’t\\nintend for its filters to change how many see themselves or present themselves\\nto others, or to drive some to pursue cosmetic surgery in an effort to recreate the\\nlook provided by the filters in the app. And it surely didn’t intend for the app’s\\ndisappearing videos to be used for sexual harassment or to become a haven for\\nsexual predators.\\nSadly, I could fill a whole chapter with examples like these—but I think\\nyou get the point. It’s hard to imagine these companies intended the negative\\nconsequences that resulted from the services they provided or the features they\\nintroduced. And yet those consequences did occur, and the harm created by these\\n150 | LAWS OF UX\\n9 Adrian F . Ward, Kristen Duke, Ayelet Gneezy, and Maarten W.

The same technology\\nthat enables us to so easily purchase, connect, or consume can also distract us,\\naffect our behavior, and impact the relationships we have with others around us.\\nPsychology and its application in user experience design plays a critical role in\\nall of this: behavior design is useful for keeping people “hooked,” but at what\\ncost? When did “daily active users” or “time on site” become a more meaningful\\nmetric than whether a product is actually helping people achieve their goals or\\nfacilitating meaningful connections?\\nEthics must be an integral part of the design process, because without this\\ncheck and balance, there may be no one advocating for the end user within the\\ncompanies and organizations creating technology. The commercial imperatives\\nto increase time on site, streamline the consumption of media and advertising,\\nor extract valuable data don’t match up with human objectives of accomplishing\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 151\\na task, staying connected with friends or family, and so on. In other words,\\nthe corporate goals of the business and the human goals of the end user are\\nseldom aligned, and more often than not, designers are a conduit between them.\\nIf behavior can be shaped by technology, who holds the companies that build\\ntechnology to account for the decisions they make?\\nIt’s time that designers confront this tension and accept that it’s our respon-\\nsibility to create products and experiences that support and align with the goals\\nand well-being of users. In other words, we should build technology that aug-\\nments the human experience rather than replacing it with virtual interaction\\nand rewards. The first step in making ethical design decisions is to acknowledge\\nhow the human mind can be exploited. We must then take accountability for\\nthe technology we help to create and ensure it respects people’s time, attention,\\nand overall digital well-being. No longer is “moving fast and breaking things”\\nan acceptable means of building technology—instead, we must slow down and\\nbe intentional with the technology we create and consider how it’s impacting\\npeople’s lives.\\nSlow Down and Be Intentional\\nTo ensure we are building products and services that support the goals of the\\npeople using them, it’s imperative that ethics are integrated into the design\\nprocess. The following are a few common approaches to ensuring the human\\npart of “human-centered design” remains at the forefront.\\nTHINK BEYOND THE HAPPY PATH\\nScenarios provide a frame of reference for designers—they’re essential to defin-\\ning critical features and functionality that must be available when a person uses\\na product or service. Unfortunately, teams that move fast and break things tend\\nto focus exclusively on the idealized scenarios around idealized users that provide\\nthe path of least resistance. These “happy paths” are, by their very nature, devoid\\nof use cases for when things go wrong outside of simple technical errors. This\\nmeans that failure to anticipate the long-term consequences of design decisions\\nin favor of short-term gain often leads to negligent and sometimes harmful\\noutcomes. In other words, technology that scales without considering scenarios\\nthat stray from the happy path become ticking time bombs that leave the people\\nexisting outside these idealized scenarios vulnerable.\\nA better approach is to change the definition of the minimum viable product\\n(MVP) to focus on nonideal scenarios first, as opposed to the path of least\\nresistance. By placing edge cases at the center of our thinking, we can ensure\\n152 | LAWS OF UX\\nthat we’re creating more resilient products and services that consider the most\\nvulnerable cases by default.\\nDIVERSIFY TEAMS AND THINKING\\nHomogeneous teams often have difficulty identifying blind spots that exist out-\\nside their own shared life experiences. This inevitably leads to less-resilient prod-\\nucts and services, which can have disastrous results when things go wrong. To\\navoid the pitfalls of homogeneous thinking, there are a number of things that\\nteams responsible for building technology can do. First, they can ensure they’re\\nas diverse as possible—a team comprising different genders, races, ages, and\\nbackgrounds brings a broader spectrum of human experience into the design\\nprocess from the outset. It’s also important to ensure the personas derived from\\ntarget audience research aren’t exclusively focused on the user segments consid-\\nered essential for an MVP—the more diverse the audience you design for, the\\nmore likely it is that you’ll catch blind spots before they become bigger problems.\\nLOOK BEYOND DATA\\nQuantitative data tells us lots of useful things, such as how quickly people are\\nperforming tasks, what they are looking at, and how they are interacting with the\\nsystem. What this data doesn’t tell us is why users are behaving a certain way\\nor how the product is impacting their lives. It’s critical to consider other metrics\\nin order to gain insight into the why, and to do that we must both listen and\\nbe receptive to our users. This means getting out from behind a screen, talking\\nwith them, and then using this qualitative research to inform how we evolve the\\ndesign in an impactful way.\\nTechnology has the ability to significantly affect people’s lives, and it’s crucial\\nthat we ensure that impact is positive. It’s our responsibility to create products\\nand experiences that support and align with the goals and well-being of users.\\nWe can make ethical design decisions by acknowledging how the human mind\\ncan be exploited and take accountability for our work by thinking beyond the\\nhappy path scenarios, building more diverse teams, and talking with users to\\ngain qualitative feedback on how the products and experiences we build affect\\ntheir lives.\\nEMBRACE FRICTION\\nSteve Jobs once referred to the personal computer as a “bicycle for the mind”:\\na tool that could expand our capabilities and improve our lives. Fast-forward to\\nnow, and in many ways, that’s exactly what has been achieved. Many of us carry\\nWITH POWER COMES RESPONSIBILITY | 153\\npersonal computers small enough to fit in our back pockets, with more comput-\\ning power than anything available at the time of Jobs’s famous analogy. But we’ve\\nalso seen something that perhaps Jobs didn’t anticipate: instead of technology\\nenhancing our abilities as humans, it’s become a vehicle for extracting our\\nattention, monetizing our personal information, and exploiting our psychological\\nvulnerabilities.\\nAt the heart of this effort is the total elimination of friction. We’ve been\\nmade to think that any friction within a user journey is negative and should\\nbe eliminated wherever possible, to the point that frictionless has become synony-\\nmous with good user experience. But friction can also be a valuable tool when\\nused appropriately, from preventing errors, enhancing security, and avoiding\\nunintentional actions and consequences to building credibility, promoting criti-\\ncal thought, or encouraging moderation. We can embrace friction to prevent\\nabuse, protect privacy, steer people toward healthier digital habits, and encourage\\nthe consideration of long-term consequences versus short-term gain.\\n154 |
